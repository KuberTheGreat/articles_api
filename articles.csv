The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. ""Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,"" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, ""Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype."" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a ""significant"" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. ""A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' "" he said. ""It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation."" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. ""Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,"" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. ""Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,"" Mr. Bonneau said. ""It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.""",en

Under this plan, new, custom-developed government software must be made available for use across other federal agencies, and a portion of all projects must be made open source and shared with the public. This plan will make it much easier to share best practices, collaborate, and save money across different government departments. However, there are still some questions to address. In good open source style, the White House is inviting developers to comment on this policy. As the Drupal community we should take advantage and comment on GitHub within the 30-day feedback window. The White House has a long open source history with Drupal . In October 2009, WhiteHouse.gov relaunched on Drupal and shortly thereafter started to actively contribute back to Drupal -- both were a first in the history of the White House. White House's contributions to Drupal include the ""We the People"" petitions platform , which was adopted by other governments and organizations around the world. This week's policy is big news because it will push open source deeper into the roots of the U.S. government, requiring more government agencies to become active open source contributors. We'll be able to solve problems faster and, together, build better software for citizens across the U.S. I'm excited to see how this plays out in the coming months!

To a human, these commands just sound like random white noise, but they could be used to tell a voice-activated assistant like Amazon's Alexa to do things that its owner never intended. Nicholas Carlini, one of the Byzantine audio researchers, says that their tests have been able to activate open source audio recognizers, Siri, and Google Now in their tests, with accuracy on all three more than 90 percent. The noise sounds like a science-fiction alien transmission. It's a garbled mix of white noise and human voice, but certainly unrecognizable as a command. With this attack, any phone that hears the noise (they have to specifically target iOS or Android) could be unknowingly forced to visit a webpage that plays the noise, and thus infect other phones near it, Carlini says. In that same scenario, the webpage could also silently download malware onto the device. There's also the possibility these noises could be played over the radio, hidden in white noise or background audio. These attacks can happen because the machine is trained to think that there's readable or important data in almost every input, and also that some things are more common than others, says Goodfellow. It's easier to fool the network into thinking it's seeing a common object, because it thinks that it should be seeing it more commonly. That's why Goodfellow and a separate group at University of Wyoming are able to make the network classify images when there's nothing there, by making it identify white noise, randomly generated black and white imagery. In Goodfellow's research, random white noise he put through the network was most often classified as a horse. This coincidentally brings us back to Clever Hans, our not so mathematically-gifted horse from earlier. Much like Clever Hans, Goodfellow says these neural networks aren't really learning certain ideas, but just how to recognize when they finds the right idea. The distinction is slight, but important. This lack of foundational knowledge makes it easy to maliciously recreate the experience of finding the ""right"" outcome for the algorithm, which is actually a false answer. To understand what is, the machine also must understand what is not. Goodfellow found that when he trained his image classifying networks with both the natural images, and the doctored images (specifying that they were fake), he not only could reduce the efficiency of the attack by more than 90 percent, but the network was better at its original task. ""When you start forcing them to explain the really unusual adversarial examples, it might come up with a even more robust explanation of what the underlying concepts are,"" Goodfellow says. The two audio groups have also used the same approach as the Google researchers to patch language recognition systems against their own attacks, by retraining their networks. They've achieved similar levels of success, with more than 90 percent reduction in attack efficiency. ""It's probably fairly easy for an adversary to fool us, to deceive us. Some of that may be benign, some of that may not be."" It's no surprise that this area of research has garnered interest from the United States military. In fact, the Army Research Laboratory actually sponsored at least two of the most recent papers, including the black box attack. While the Army Lab is proactive in funding research, this doesn't mean the tech is in active development for use in warfare. According to a spokesperson, research usually takes upwards of 10 years to make its way into soldier's hands. Ananthram Swami, a researcher with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, has had varying levels of participation in recent papers concerning adversarial attacks. The Army's interest lies in the detection and stopping of purposefully deceptive data, in an age where not all sources of information can be vetted properly. Swami points to the bevy of data accessible from public sensors placed by universities and open source projects. ""We don't necessarily control all that data. It's probably fairly easy for an adversary to fool us, to deceive us,"" Swami said. ""Some of that may be benign, some of that may not be."" He also says that as the Army has a vested interest in autonomous robots, tanks, and other vehicles, so this research is obvious. By studying this now, the Army would have a headstart for systems in the field that were immune to potential adversarial attacks. But any group in that uses deep neural networks, which is a quickly growing faction, should have concerns about the potential of adversarial attacks. While machine learning and artificial intelligence systems are still in their infancy, we're at a dangerous time where security oversights can have drastic results. Many companies are placing highly volatile information in the hands of artificially intelligent systems, which have not endured the scrutiny of time. Our neural networks are simply too young for us to know everything about them. A similar oversight led to Tay, Microsoft's Twitter chatbot that quickly turned into a genocidal racist. A torrent of malicious data, and a foreseeably terrible ""repeat after me"" function, led Tay to deviate wildly from her original programming. The bot was hijacked by bad training data from the wild, and serves as a handy example for what can happen when machine learning is poorly implemented. Kantchelian says that he doesn't think the door is completely closed for any of these attacks, even with the promising research from the Google team. ""At least in computer security, unfortunately the attackers are always ahead of us,"" Kantchelian says. ""So it's going to be a little dangerous to say we solved all the problems of adversarial machine learning by retraining.""",en

To a human, these commands just sound like random white noise, but they could be used to tell a voice-activated assistant like Amazon's Alexa to do things that its owner never intended. Nicholas Carlini, one of the Byzantine audio researchers, says that their tests have been able to activate open source audio recognizers, Siri, and Google Now in their tests, with accuracy on all three more than 90 percent. The noise sounds like a science-fiction alien transmission. It's a garbled mix of white noise and human voice, but certainly unrecognizable as a command. With this attack, any phone that hears the noise (they have to specifically target iOS or Android) could be unknowingly forced to visit a webpage that plays the noise, and thus infect other phones near it, Carlini says. In that same scenario, the webpage could also silently download malware onto the device. There's also the possibility these noises could be played over the radio, hidden in white noise or background audio. These attacks can happen because the machine is trained to think that there's readable or important data in almost every input, and also that some things are more common than others, says Goodfellow. It's easier to fool the network into thinking it's seeing a common object, because it thinks that it should be seeing it more commonly. That's why Goodfellow and a separate group at University of Wyoming are able to make the network classify images when there's nothing there, by making it identify white noise, randomly generated black and white imagery. In Goodfellow's research, random white noise he put through the network was most often classified as a horse. This coincidentally brings us back to Clever Hans, our not so mathematically-gifted horse from earlier. Much like Clever Hans, Goodfellow says these neural networks aren't really learning certain ideas, but just how to recognize when they finds the right idea. The distinction is slight, but important. This lack of foundational knowledge makes it easy to maliciously recreate the experience of finding the ""right"" outcome for the algorithm, which is actually a false answer. To understand what is, the machine also must understand what is not. Goodfellow found that when he trained his image classifying networks with both the natural images, and the doctored images (specifying that they were fake), he not only could reduce the efficiency of the attack by more than 90 percent, but the network was better at its original task. ""When you start forcing them to explain the really unusual adversarial examples, it might come up with a even more robust explanation of what the underlying concepts are,"" Goodfellow says. The two audio groups have also used the same approach as the Google researchers to patch language recognition systems against their own attacks, by retraining their networks. They've achieved similar levels of success, with more than 90 percent reduction in attack efficiency. ""It's probably fairly easy for an adversary to fool us, to deceive us. Some of that may be benign, some of that may not be."" It's no surprise that this area of research has garnered interest from the United States military. In fact, the Army Research Laboratory actually sponsored at least two of the most recent papers, including the black box attack. While the Army Lab is proactive in funding research, this doesn't mean the tech is in active development for use in warfare. According to a spokesperson, research usually takes upwards of 10 years to make its way into soldier's hands. Ananthram Swami, a researcher with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, has had varying levels of participation in recent papers concerning adversarial attacks. The Army's interest lies in the detection and stopping of purposefully deceptive data, in an age where not all sources of information can be vetted properly. Swami points to the bevy of data accessible from public sensors placed by universities and open source projects. ""We don't necessarily control all that data. It's probably fairly easy for an adversary to fool us, to deceive us,"" Swami said. ""Some of that may be benign, some of that may not be."" He also says that as the Army has a vested interest in autonomous robots, tanks, and other vehicles, so this research is obvious. By studying this now, the Army would have a headstart for systems in the field that were immune to potential adversarial attacks. But any group in that uses deep neural networks, which is a quickly growing faction, should have concerns about the potential of adversarial attacks. While machine learning and artificial intelligence systems are still in their infancy, we're at a dangerous time where security oversights can have drastic results. Many companies are placing highly volatile information in the hands of artificially intelligent systems, which have not endured the scrutiny of time. Our neural networks are simply too young for us to know everything about them. A similar oversight led to Tay, Microsoft's Twitter chatbot that quickly turned into a genocidal racist. A torrent of malicious data, and a foreseeably terrible ""repeat after me"" function, led Tay to deviate wildly from her original programming. The bot was hijacked by bad training data from the wild, and serves as a handy example for what can happen when machine learning is poorly implemented. Kantchelian says that he doesn't think the door is completely closed for any of these attacks, even with the promising research from the Google team. ""At least in computer security, unfortunately the attackers are always ahead of us,"" Kantchelian says. ""So it's going to be a little dangerous to say we solved all the problems of adversarial machine learning by retraining.""",en

The idea was you could develop once for Windows 10 desktop and easily share that code on any device, making it impossibly attractive for developers, which would finally drive Windows Mobile popularity in a beautiful virtuous development cycle. Unfortunately it hasn't worked out that way, and Microsoft finds itself in an unusual position, developing software for iOS and Android because it simply doesn't have a viable Windows mobile ecosystem. According to comScore's latest marketshare numbers , Microsoft had 2.9 percent marketshare in the US for the fourth quarter last year. That was unchanged since September in case you were wondering. In its fourth quarter earnings report in January, Microsoft reported a smartphone platform deeply in decline . That would cover the period where the Windows 10 mobile development magic was supposed to be happening. As you can plainly see, the plan doesn't seem to have worked as drawn up. Windows 10 is out. It appears to be getting great adoption on 270 million devices , but it doesn't seemed to have trickled down to Windows smartphones much at all. Singing different tunes Here's how Satya Nadella outlined how how he hoped his mobile strategy would play out in an interview with Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet last year: ""[T]he free upgrade for Windows 10 is meant to improve our phone position. That is the reason why I made that decision. If somebody wants to know whether I'm committed to Windows Phone, they should think about what I just did with the free upgrade to Windows, rather than - hey, I['m] making four more phone models of value smart phones."" In an interview with Matt Rosoff from Business Insider this week, Rosoff pointed out the lack of discussion of Windows mobile at last week's Build Developer conference. Nadella's position was more nuanced this time : First of all, I don't think of Windows for mobile differently than Windows for HoloLens or Windows for Xbox now. We have only one Windows. We don't have multiple Windows. They run across multiple form factors, but it's one developer platform, one store, one tool chain for developers. And you adapt it for different screen sizes and different input and output. TechCrunch's Haje Jans Kamps also noticed that Windows phone was conspicuously absent from the Build conference keynote discussions. At one point while introducing Xamarin, the presenter put it like this: ""We don't care if it's Android or iOS, we have you covered,"" the presenter said, and continued onto the rest of his presentation. Spot any platforms missing from that two-bulletpoint-list,"" Kamps wondered with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. Getting by with some help from their friends The question remains can Microsoft succeed without a strong Windows mobile position? From the looks of things, they don't seem to have much choice. Nadella appears to be staking his position in the cloud, which is a perfectly reasonable way to play it, while opening up his company's tools to iOS and Android in the absence of any meaningful Windows phone adoption. When you look at the beauty of the mobile-cloud connection, it's understandable Microsoft would want to be there with Windows, but perhaps Nadella is beginning to understand that Windows is not necessarily the future of the company - Azure and Office 365 are - and that could explain why the company stayed firmly focused on these two areas at Build. When you combine that with the idea of bots created by Microsoft including Cortana (Microsoft's talking virtual assistant), that can run in Microsoft's tools or external platforms like Slack and LINE, you start to see a vision where Microsoft thrives even without an in-house mobile platform. As the world moves swiftly to that mobile-cloud intersection, perhaps the underlying OS becomes less important. If that's the case if Microsoft can have a piece of the underlying cloud-mobile plumbing and have apps and bots created in its ecosystem, run anywhere on any device - rendering the Windows phone gap irrelevant. For Microsoft with its weak mobile position, it had better hope that's the case.",en

É assim que devemos iniciar a discussão sobre um dos assuntos mais comentados na atualidade: A raridade e, por consequência, a dificuldade em encontrar talentos para os times de analytics e data science. Em pesquisa recente feita pela Nucleus Research , analisando grandes empresas com a correta utilização de analytics e data science, encontramos que a cada dólar investido corretamente na competência, obtemos um ROI de $13.01 (Número que era $10.66 em 2011). Em outras palavras, a cada vez que investimos em pessoas, processos e tecnologia na área de analytics e data science, recebemos de volta 10x a mais o valor investido. E esse número vem aumentando com o exponencial avanço e expansão da área. Outro número interessante divulgado no eMetrics Summit 2016 , é que um profissional de analytics e data science, inserido no momento e contexto correto, pode gerar para a empresa a receita ou saving de $107k-$554k ao ano. Mas onde achar esse profissional que une habilidades tão raras? Encontrar habilidades estatísticas, tecnológicas e de negócios em um único profissional me parece realmente como caçar um unicórnio. Trago uma boa notícia a você: Você não precisa de unicórnios. Você precisa de Malamutes do Alaska. Os Malamutes do Alaska são os cães fortes e robustos que os esquimós utilizam para puxar trenós em baixíssimas temperaturas e nos terrenos mais adversos. Na analogia, eles são os as pessoas que usarão o trabalho em equipe para levar sua empresa até o destino enfrentando longas viagens, adaptando-se em altas variações de temperatura e nos mais difíceis terrenos. Outra boa notícia é que, diferente da existência do unicórnio, a existência do Malamute do Alaska não é um mito, eles existem. A má notícia é que eles ainda são difíceis de achar. Algumas habilidades que você deve caçar além do engajamento são: O profissional com habilidade de fazer acontecer com os recursos disponíveis; O open source guru que irá te ajudar com as soluções disponíveis no mercado; O profissional com a habilidade de criar modelos de análise com embasamento estatístico; O deep diver, que irá mergulhar nas mais profundas entranhas para chegar as análises que deseja; O storyteller, que possui ótima habilidade de comunicação e capaz de contar belas histórias que os dados nos contarão; A pessoa curiosa e questionadora que irá evitar que nos precipitemos; E por fim, o perfil que coloca sempre a privacidade dos usuários análisados em primeiro lugar; Um profissional pode conter uma ou ""N"" habilidades, mas nosso trenó irá mais longe se for puxado por ""cães"" com essas habilidades. Porém, você pode começar a montar a ""matilha"" da sua empresa através das unidades de negócio. Comece entregando valor e diversos kickwins para a unidade em questão. Certamente eles possuem necessidades que você, utilizando o poder do analytics e data science, pode ajudar de forma rápida. Isso gera a fome de dados e por consequência o engajamento. As unidades de negócio possuem habilidade de enxergar significância de negócio em análises, que possui um peso grande quando vem antes da significância estatística (Sim, existe uma diferença e isso não quer dizer que uma é mais importante que outra, mas a primeira deve sempre vir antes da segunda). Vá empoderando esses usuários aos poucos com a ajuda das diversas plataformas que temos disponíveis . E por fim vá criando a governança e os processos que te sustentarão nessa jornada. No decorrer do caminho você terá tempo para caçar os Malamutes do Alaska corretos para sua ""matilha"". Além disso, irão aparecer naturalmente Malamutes do Alaska nas suas unidades de negócio. Criando a estrutura de time correta, utilizando as ferramentas da melhor forma possível para suprir as necessidades e com uma grande estratégia, é possível colher os grandes frutos da competência.",pt

Simply put, these are the scenarios you never imagined when designing your product. They are otherwise referred to as the ""unknown"" type. Their impact is unpredictable and can range from embarrassing to catastrophic . Common Causes Insufficient Research You've probably heard the phrase that that when you assume, you make an ass out of you and me. Assumed value is no different and can come with tricky nuances. When these are not researched, an unknown bug hatches! Ignorance Someone realizes the ""implementation is wrong"" at release time, even though the expected behavior was not specified! Sound familiar? These bugs come into existence due to the lack 0f specifications. Highest Impact Quality Function Behaviour Driven Development Huh? Again? Yep! The deliberate discovery stage of BDD is a great way to use the wisdom of crowds and identify unknowns. The discovery stage is not unidirectional but rather, it's iterative. It is intended to create questions as well as answers. Some of these questions require further research to feed back to the team. This cycle of interactions is an excellent way to deliberately discover unknown specifications. Summing it up For the foreseeable future, as long as we create software, we will inadvertently create some bugs. But just my old man can share with me a proven technique to save my night's sleep, so we can learn some great techniques to save us a lifetime of fighting bugs. The trick is not to think about how to fight them, it is to understand how to never invite them into a fight in the first place.

The feedback you've shared to-date has helped us catch bugs and improve features. Today, the second release in our series of Developer Previews is ready for you to continue testing against your apps. This latest preview of Android N fixes a few bugs you helped us identify, such as not being able to connect to hidden Wi-Fi networks ( AOSP 203116 ), Multiwindow pauses ( AOSP 203424 ), and Direct Reply closing an open activity ( AOSP 204411 ), to name just a few. We're still on the hunt for more; please continue to share feedback, either in the N Developer Preview issue tracker or in the N preview community . What's new: Last month's Developer Preview introduced a host of new features , like Multi-window, bundled notifications and more. This preview builds on those and includes a few new ones: New human emoji New activity emoji API changes: This update includes API changes as we continue to refine features such as multi-window support (you can now specify a separate minimum height and minimum width for an activity), notifications, and others. For details, take a look at the diff reports available in the downloadable API reference package . Bug fixes: We've resolved a number of issues throughout the system, including these fixes for issues that you've reported through the public issue tracker. Please continue to let us know what you find and follow along with the known issues here . How to get the update: The easiest way to get this and later preview updates is by enrolling your devices in the Android Beta Program . Just visit g.co/androidbeta and opt-in your eligible Android phone or tablet -- you'll soon receive this (and later) preview updates over-the-air. If you've already enrolled your device, you'll receive the update shortly, no action is needed on your part. You can also download and flash this update manually . Developer Preview 2 is intended for developers and not as a daily driver; this build is not yet optimized for performance and battery life. The N Developer Preview is currently available for Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, and Pixel C devices, as well as General Mobile 4G [Android One] devices. For Nexus Player, the update to Developer Preview 2 will follow the other devices by several days. To build and test apps with Developer Preview 2, you need to use Android Studio 2.1 -- the same version that was required for Developer Preview 1. You'll need to check for SDK components updates (including build tools and emulator system images) for Developer Preview 2 -- see here for details. Thanks so much for all of your feedback so far. Please continue to share feedback, either in the N Developer Preview issue tracker or in the N preview community . The sooner we're able to get your feedback, the more of of it we will be able to incorporate in the next release of Android.",en

They recorded the brain activity of 50 subjects wearing an electroencephalograph (EEG) headset while looking at selected images from a set of 500 images. The researchers found that participants' brains reacted uniquely to each image - enough so that a computer system that analyzed the different reactions was able to identify each volunteer's ""brainprint"" with 100 percent accuracy. In their original brainprint study in 2015, published in Neurocomputing (see 'Brainprints' could replace passwords ), the research team was able to identify one person out of a group of 32 by that person's responses, with 97 percent accuracy. That study only used words. Switching to images made a huge difference. High-security sites It's only a three-point difference, but going from 97 to 100 percent makes possible a reliable system for high-security situations, such as ""ensuring the person going into the Pentagon or the nuclear launch bay is the right person,"" said Assistant Professor of Psychology Sarah Laszlo. ""You don't want to be 97 percent accurate for that, you want to be 100 percent accurate."" Laszlo says brain biometrics are appealing because they can be cancelled (meaning the person can simple do another EEG session) and cannot be imitated or stolen by malicious means, the way a finger or retina can (as in the movie Minority Report ). ""If someone's fingerprint is stolen, that person can't just grow a new finger to replace the compromised fingerprint - the fingerprint for that person is compromised forever. Fingerprints are 'non-cancellable.' Brainprints, on the other hand, are potentially cancellable. So, in the unlikely event that attackers were actually able to steal a brainprint from an authorized user, the authorized user could then 'reset' their brainprint,"" Laszlo explained. Analyzing ""event-related potential"" brain signals The researchers found in their original study that the key to detecting differences in brain signals was to look at and analyze "" event-related potential (ERP) brain signals recorded from each subject. ERPs are brain signals that are triggered by specific events (such as seeing a photo). Unlike EEG signals, ERPs are unique and happen over a period of a few milliseconds. How ERPs are identified The researchers used six types of stimuli in the CEREBRE protocol: sine gratings, low frequency words, color versions of black and white images, black and white foods, black and white celebrity faces, and color foods. For the foods and celebrity faces, they used ten tokens of each stimulus type (e.g., 10 different foods). As the authors note in a new paper in The IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security , ""We ... predict that, while ERPs elicited in response to single categories of stimulation (e.g., foods) will be somewhat identifiable, combinations of ERPs elicited in response to multiple categories of stimulation will be even more identifiable. ""This prediction is supported by the likelihood that each category of stimulation will draw upon differing (though overlapping) brain systems. For example, if the sine gratings call primarily upon the primary visual cortex, and the foods call primarily on the ventral midbrain, then considering both responses together for biometric identification provides multiple, independent, pieces of information about the user's functional brain organization - each of which can contribute unique variability to the overall biometric solution."" Andrew Hatling/Binghamton University | The New Biometric - Brainprint Abstract of CEREBRE: A Novel Method for Very High Accuracy Event-Related Potential Biometric Identification The vast majority of existing work on brain biometrics has been conducted on the ongoing electroencephalogram. Here, we argue that the averaged event-related potential (ERP) may provide the potential for more accurate biometric identification, as its elicitation allows for some control over the cognitive state of the user to be obtained through the design of the challenge protocol. We describe the Cognitive Event-RElated Biometric REcognition (CEREBRE) protocol, an ERP biometric protocol designed to elicit individually unique responses from multiple functional brain systems (e.g., the primary visual, facial recognition, and gustatory/appetitive systems). Results indicate that there are multiple configurations of data collected with the CEREBRE protocol that all allow 100% identification accuracy in a pool of 50 users. We take this result as the evidence that ERP biometrics are a feasible method of user identification and worthy of further research.",en

Today, we'll take a deeper dive into one of them - the storage system. We'll follow data as it's loaded into a BigQuery table.BigQuery supports several input formats - CSV, JSON, Datastore backups, AVRO - and when they're imported, data is converted into our internal representation. BigQuery uses a columnar storage that supports semistructured data - nested and repeated fields. When Google published the Dremel paper in 2010, it explained how this structure is preserved within column store. Every column, in addition to its value, also stores two numbers - definition and repetition levels. This encoding ensures that the full or partial structure of the record can be reconstructed by reading only requested columns, and never requires reading parent columns (which is the case with alternative encodings). That same paper gives an exact algorithm for both encoding the data and reconstructing the record. Example of encoding semistructured data using definition and repetition levels The definition and repetition levels encoding is so efficient for semistructured data that other open source columnar formats, such as Parquet , also adopted this technique. In addition to helping with storing and building structured records, definition and repetition levels can also be used in algorithms for efficient query processing. In 2014, Google published another paper - Storing and Querying tree-structured records in Dremel - which lays theoretical foundation and proves correctness of algorithms for filtering and aggregation operators, which take advantage of the above encoding. Now that we understand how the record structure is implemented, what about the actual values? In the last 10 years, there's been a resurgence of research in column oriented database systems. One of the classic papers in this area - Integrating Compression and Execution in Column-Oriented Database Systems - describes various techniques and encodings, such as Run Length Encoding (RLE), Dictionary encoding, Bit-Vector encoding, Frame of Reference encoding, etc. The paper discusses various tradeoffs and algorithms that can be used with these different encodings. Example of Run Length Encoding (left) and Dictionary Encoding (right). Taken from VLDB 2009 tutorial on Column Oriented Database Systems . Capacitor - the storage format in BigQuery, builds heavily on this research and employs variations and advancements of these techniques. To show one example where Capacitor advances the state of the art, we'll review the problem of reordering of input rows. This is one of the less studied problems in research (see this paper for some background). To illustrate the problem, let's consider the following example of input with 3 columns: If we were to encode these data with RLE, it would not be very optimal, since in every column every value doesn't repeat more than once, so all the run lengths would be 1, and we'll end up with total of 21 runs. However, if the input rows are reshuffled into following: we'll be able to take great advantage of RLE, and will end up with a total of 9 runs. This permutation is the optimal solution for the given input, and it produces better results than lexicographical sort by any combination of columns. Unfortunately, finding the optimal solution is known to be a NP-complete problem in computer science, which means that finding the optimal solution is not practical, even for a modest number of input rows, let alone for millions and billions of rows of typical input to BigQuery. To further complicate matters, we should notice that not all columns are born equal. Some might be very long strings, where shorter RLE runs are more beneficial than longer runs on the small integers column. Finally, we must take into account actual usage: some columns are more likely to be selected in queries than others, and some columns are more likely to be used as filters, for example in WHERE clauses. Capacitor builds an approximation model that takes into account all relevant factors and comes up with a reasonable solution. The runtime of evaluating this model is bound, since we wouldn't want data import to BigQuery to take forever! While every column is being encoded, Capacitor and BigQuery collect various statistics about the data - these statistics are persisted and later are used during query execution - they both feed into query planner to help compiling optimal plans, and into the dynamic runtime to choose most efficient runtime algorithms for required operators. Once all column data is encoded, it's written to Google's distributed file system - Colossus . More decisions must be made at this time, the most important one being how to shard the input data. A shard is a unit of processing at query time. We don't want too few shards, because we would like to take advantage of distributed processing capabilities of BigQuery, processing a table in parallel using potentially thousands of machines - each one reading individual shards. But we also don't want too many shards, because every unit of storage and processing has constant overhead. Future query patterns influence the sharding strategy as well. Queries that will read lots of columns may benefit from smaller shards, but queries that read only few might be better of with larger shards. Again, BigQuery has a model that evaluates all of the different factors, and comes up with an ideal number of shards. When data is sent to Colossus for permanent storage, all of it is encrypted. There are many levels of defense against unauthorized access in Google Cloud Platform , and 100% of data being encrypted at rest is one of them. Colossus is a reliable and fault tolerant file system, leveraging techniques such as Reed Solomon codes to ensure that data is never lost. In addition, immediately upon writing data to Colossus, BigQuery starts the geo-replication process, mirroring all the data into different data centers around the specified jurisdiction, be it US or EU. Having data in multiple data centers enables the highest availability, in case one data center is temporarily unavailable, and also helps query load balancing. For Cloud Platform users, all this encoding, encryption and replication are already included in the price of BigQuery storage! It doesn't end here. BigQuery has background processes that constantly look at all the stored data and check if it can be optimized even further. Perhaps initially data was loaded in small chunks, and without seeing all the data, some decisions were not globally optimal. Or perhaps some parameters of the system have changed, and there are new opportunities for storage restructuring. Or perhaps, Capacitor models got more trained and tuned, and it possible to enhance existing data. Whatever the case might be, when the system detects an opportunity to improve storage, it kickstarts data conversion tasks. These tasks do not compete with queries for resources, they run completely in parallel, and don't degrade query performance. Once the new, optimized storage is complete, it atomically replaces old storage data - without interfering with running queries. Old data will be garbage-collected later. BigQuery performs all this maintenance behind the scenes, and it's completely invisible to you, and free of charge, both money and performance. BigQuery is a true NoOps service - it lets you focus on solving your business problems, and takes care of managing the rest for you!",en

Entities such as methods and properties are declared only once but used repeatedly. Design APIs to make those uses clear and concise. When evaluating a design, reading a declaration is seldom sufficient; always examine a use case to make sure it looks clear in context. Clarity is more important than brevity. Although Swift code can be compact, it is a non-goal to enable the smallest possible code with the fewest characters. Brevity in Swift code, where it occurs, is a side-effect of the strong type system and features that naturally reduce boilerplate. If you are having trouble describing your API's functionality in simple terms, you may have designed the wrong API. Begin with a summary that describes the entity being declared. Often, an API can be completely understood from its declaration and its summary. Focus on the summary ; it's the most important part. Many excellent documentation comments consist of nothing more than a great summary. Use a single sentence fragment if possible, ending with a period. Do not use a complete sentence. Describe what a function or method does and what it returns , omitting null effects and Void returns: Note: in rare cases like popFirst above, the summary is formed of multiple sentence fragments separated by semicolons. Describe what a subscript accesses : Describe what an initializer creates : For all other declarations, describe what the declared entity is . Optionally, continue with one or more paragraphs and bullet items. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines and use complete sentences. /// Writes the textual representation of each <span class=""graphic"">←</span><span class=""commentary""> Summary</span> /// element of `items` to the standard output. /// <span class=""graphic"">←</span><span class=""commentary""> Blank line</span> /// The textual representation for each item `x` <span class=""graphic"">←</span><span class=""commentary""> Additional discussion</span> /// is generated by the expression `String(x)`. /// /// - **Parameter separator**: text to be printed <span class=""graphic"">⎫</span> /// between items. <span class=""graphic"">⎟</span> /// - **Parameter terminator**: text to be printed <span class=""graphic"">⎬</span><span class=""commentary""> <a href="" section</a></span> /// at the end. <span class=""graphic"">⎟</span> /// <span class=""graphic"">⎭</span> /// - **Note**: To print without a trailing <span class=""graphic"">⎫</span> /// newline, pass `terminator: """"` <span class=""graphic"">⎟</span> /// <span class=""graphic"">⎬</span><span class=""commentary""> <a href="" commands</a></span> /// - **SeeAlso**: `CustomDebugStringConvertible`, <span class=""graphic"">⎟</span> /// `CustomStringConvertible`, `debugPrint`. <span class=""graphic"">⎭</span> public func print < Target : OutputStreamType > ( items : Any ... , separator : String = "" "" , terminator : String = "" \n "" ) Use recognized symbol documentation markup elements to add information beyond the summary, whenever appropriate. Know and use recognized bullet items with symbol command syntax . Popular development tools such as Xcode give special treatment to bullet items that start with the following keywords: Naming Include all the words needed to avoid ambiguity for a person reading code where the name is used. Omit needless words. Every word in a name should convey salient information at the use site. More words may be needed to clarify intent or disambiguate meaning, but those that are redundant with information the reader already possesses should be omitted. In particular, omit words that merely repeat type information. In this case, the word Element adds nothing salient at the call site. This API would be better: Occasionally, repeating type information is necessary to avoid ambiguity, but in general it is better to use a word that describes a parameter's role rather than its type. See the next item for details. Name variables, parameters, and associated types according to their roles, rather than their type constraints. Repurposing a type name in this way fails to optimize clarity and expressivity. Instead, strive to choose a name that expresses the entity's role . If an associated type is so tightly bound to its protocol constraint that the protocol name is the role, avoid collision by appending Type to the associated type name: Compensate for weak type information to clarify a parameter's role. Especially when a parameter type is NSObject , Any , AnyObject , or a fundamental type such Int or String , type information and context at the point of use may not fully convey intent. In this example, the declaration may be clear, but the use site is vague. To restore clarity, precede each weakly typed parameter with a noun describing its role : Strive for Fluent Usage Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases. It is acceptable for fluency to degrade after the first argument or two when those arguments are not central to the call's meaning: Begin names of factory methods with "" make "", e.g. x.makeIterator() . Initializer and factory method calls should form a phrase that does not include the first argument, e.g. x.makeWidget(cogCount: 47) For example, the phrases implied by these calls do not include the first argument: In the following, the API author has tried to create grammatical continuity with the first argument. In practice, this guideline along with those for argument labels means the first argument will have a label unless the call is performing a full-width type conversion . Name functions and methods according to their side-effects Uses of Boolean methods and properties should read as assertions about the receiver when the use is nonmutating, e.g. x.isEmpty , line1.intersects(line2) . Protocols that describe what something is should read as nouns (e.g. Collection ). Protocols that describe a capability should be named using the suffixes able , ible , or ing (e.g. Equatable , ProgressReporting ). The names of other types, properties, variables, and constants should read as nouns. Use Terminology Well Term of Art noun - a word or phrase that has a precise, specialized meaning within a particular field or profession. Avoid obscure terms if a more common word conveys meaning just as well. Don't say ""epidermis"" if ""skin"" will serve your purpose. Terms of art are an essential communication tool, but should only be used to capture crucial meaning that would otherwise be lost. Stick to the established meaning if you do use a term of art. The only reason to use a technical term rather than a more common word is that it precisely expresses something that would otherwise be ambiguous or unclear. Therefore, an API should use the term strictly in accordance with its accepted meaning. Don't surprise an expert : anyone already familiar with the term will be surprised and probably angered if we appear to have invented a new meaning for it. Don't confuse a beginner : anyone trying to learn the term is likely to do a web search and find its traditional meaning. Avoid abbreviations. Abbreviations, especially non-standard ones, are effectively terms-of-art, because understanding depends on correctly translating them into their non-abbreviated forms. The intended meaning for any abbreviation you use should be easily found by a web search. Embrace precedent. Don't optimize terms for the total beginner at the expense of conformance to existing culture. It is better to name a contiguous data structure Array than to use a simplified term such as List , even though a beginner might grasp of the meaning of List more easily. Arrays are fundamental in modern computing, so every programmer knows-or will soon learn-what an array is. Use a term that most programmers are familiar with, and their web searches and questions will be rewarded. Within a particular programming domain , such as mathematics, a widely precedented term such as sin(x) is preferable to an explanatory phrase such as verticalPositionOnUnitCircleAtOriginOfEndOfRadiusWithAngle(x) . Note that in this case, precedent outweighs the guideline to avoid abbreviations: although the complete word is sine , ""sin( x )"" has been in common use among programmers for decades, and among mathematicians for centuries. Conventions General Conventions Document the complexity of any computed property that is not O(1). People often assume that property access involves no significant computation, because they have stored properties as a mental model. Be sure to alert them when that assumption may be violated. Prefer methods and properties to free functions. Free functions are used only in special cases: When there's no obvious self : When the function is an unconstrained generic: When function syntax is part of the established domain notation: Follow case conventions. Names of types and protocols are UpperCamelCase . Everything else is lowerCamelCase . Acronyms and initialisms that commonly appear as all upper case in American English should be uniformly up- or down-cased according to case conventions: Other acronyms should be treated as ordinary words: Methods can share a base name when they share the same basic meaning or when they operate in distinct domains. For example, the following is encouraged, since the methods do essentially the same things: And since geometric types and collections are separate domains, this is also fine in the same program: However, these index methods have different semantics, and should have been named differently: Lastly, avoid ""overloading on return type"" because it causes ambiguities in the presence of type inference. Parameters Choose parameter names to serve documentation . Even though parameter names do not appear at a function or method's point of use, they play an important explanatory role. Take advantage of defaulted parameters when it simplifies common uses. Any parameter with a single commonly-used value is a candidate for a default. Default arguments improve readability by hiding irrelevant information. For example: can become the much simpler: Default arguments are generally preferable to the use of method families, because they impose a lower cognitive burden on anyone trying to understand the API. The above may not be simple, but it is much simpler than: Every member of a method family needs to be separately documented and understood by users. To decide among them, a user needs to understand all of them, and occasional surprising relationships-for example, foo(bar: nil) and foo() aren't always synonyms-make this a tedious process of ferreting out minor differences in mostly identical documentation. Using a single method with defaults provides a vastly superior programmer experience. Prefer to locate parameters with defaults toward the end of the parameter list. Parameters without defaults are usually more essential to the semantics of a method, and provide a stable initial pattern of use where methods are invoked. Argument Labels Omit all labels when arguments can't be usefully distinguished , e.g. min(number1, number2) , zip(sequence1, sequence2) . In initializers that perform full-width type conversions, omit the first argument label , e.g. Int64(someUInt32) The first argument should always be the source of the conversion. extension String { // Convert `x` into its textual representation in the given radix init(**_** x: BigInt, radix: Int = 10) <span class=""commentary"">← Note the initial underscore</span> } text = ""The value is: "" text += **String(veryLargeNumber)** text += "" and in hexadecimal, it's"" text += **String(veryLargeNumber, radix: 16)** In ""narrowing"" type conversions, though, a label that describes the narrowing is recommended. When the first argument forms part of a prepositional phrase , give it an argument label . The argument label should normally begin at the preposition , e.g. x.removeBoxes(havingLength: 12) . Otherwise, if the first argument forms part of a grammatical phrase, omit its label , appending any preceding words to the base name, e.g. x.addSubview(y) This guideline implies that if the first argument doesn't form part of a grammatical phrase, it should have a label. Note that it's important that the phrase convey the correct meaning. The following would be grammatical but would express the wrong thing. Note also that arguments with default values can be omitted, and in that case do not form part of a grammatical phrase, so they should always have labels. Label all other arguments . Special Instructions Label closure parameters and tuple members where they appear in your API. Take extra care with unconstrained polymorphism (e.g. Any , AnyObject , and unconstrained generic parameters) to avoid ambiguities in overload sets. For example, consider this overload set: These methods form a semantic family, and the argument types appear at first to be sharply distinct. However, when Element is Any , a single element can have the same type as a sequence of elements. To eliminate the ambiguity, name the second overload more explicitly. Notice how the new name better matches the documentation comment. In this case, the act of writing the documentation comment actually brought the issue to the API author's attention.",en

You obviously had to be logged into AIM, with just the right away message that told your real friends you were still nearby (and you better not skimp on your buddy profile). But you couldn't ignore your MySpace IM or Yahoo Messenger, just in case your maybe-real Internet crushes wanted to chat. And you gotta keep up your nerd cred on IRC. Being popular was hard work! Franz is a free app that combines more than a dozen different messaging services into a single window. Now, though, technology has become more sophisticated and user-friendly. And as messaging has become a key component of how we do almost everything online, our interaction with chat is easy and understandable part of our everyday lives. Wait, no, that's wrong. It's the exact opposite. Messaging is more important, more powerful, and more versatile, and yet wrangling all of our constant conversations together is like herding cats. Except there are a thousand cats, and they're all rabid and loud and running in every direction as fast as they possibly can while meowing horribly offensive things about all the other cats and giving you really important work deadlines. It's not a pretty picture. Years ago, apps like Adium, Meebo, and Trillian quickly became a crucial part of every Internet Socialite's arsenal. All your accounts in one place, neatly organized, so you could remember who's who and what's where at all times. There's nothing like that now, and there really couldn't be; messaging apps are more than just text-sending protocols, they're entire platforms. Every platform is different, and there's no way to neatly combine them. The best we can hope for is to at least bring all those disparate things into one place, which is exactly what Franz does. Franz is a new-ish free app for Mac, Windows, and Linux, that combines more than a dozen different messaging services into a single window. When you open Franz, you can instantly be logged into Slack, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Skype, Hangouts, and more. The app itself is just a container-you're basically opening web views of all the apps, tabbed in a single lovely window. By combining them into one place, though, you get a single set of notifications for all your services. A little red ""1"" will show up next to anything with an unread message, so you know at a glance what's waiting for you. And best of all, you're not stuck switching between a dozen browser tabs or a folder full of apps. Even though you don't, it feels like you have just one messaging app. It's just Franz. Franz isn't a perfect, universal messaging solution. It's not Adium 2.0. But it's the closest thing we're probably ever going to get. As the messaging ecosystem metastasizes and becomes the universal interface for how we do everything, easy access to our many tools is much more realistic than trying to build a single Megazord Messenger that encompasses them all. And besides, this might be better anyway. You get Slack the way it's meant to be used, and with a single key command you're jumping into Facebook's most complete vision of Messenger. Until we get that universal messaging app that would make life so much easier, this is definitely the next best thing. If you bought a Sony or Sharp TV from the past couple of years and you have an iPhone, you've got yourself a new way to navigate your smartwares. At long last, Google's Android TV Remote app is now available in the iOS App Store. It replicates the functionality of the same app for Android , which has been available for years. The most useful function of the app is its double-duty microphone/keyboard feature The remote-control app for Android TV devices isn't all that full-featured-it's essentially just an app version of the plastic remote included with the Google Nexus Player . Regardless, it's a handy backup clicker or a back-from-the-dead use case for an old iPod Touch. You've got your D-pad for navigating menus. Got that home button right there, too. Back button? Check. Even has an icon on there for a-playin' and a-pausin', and you can turn the whole screen into a touchpad like some kind of weirdo. But the most useful function of the app is its double-duty microphone/keyboard feature. You can use your phone as a mouthpiece for Android TV's excellent voice search (hopefully Siri won't get jealous). The app one-ups the Nexus remote by letting you input text with your phone's touchscreen keyboard. Plus, it communicates to your TV or set-top device over Wi-Fi, so you don't need a line-of-sight connection. And yo, it's free. This week at the NAB Show , the annual trade show for people who make video content, virtual reality is going to be everywhere. Condition One , a startup-slash-studio that was earlier to VR filmmaking than most, is making one of the show's early announcements: a new VR camera called the Bison. This 360 rig is made for the kind of run-and-gun documentary shooting the company's known for. Or at least the closest you can get to that given the current state of VR tech. It won't be for sale, but it will be part of the company's toolkit as it continues to make VR movies-so if you want footage from the camera, you have to hire Condition One to shoot it. Here's the rundown on the camera itself: The Bison is named for the first thing Condition One founder Danfung Dennis shot with the initial prototype. It's comprised of 16 cameras, and all together they're capable of shooting full 360-degree video with full 3D audio. It'll produce 5.7K resolution video, at up to 48 frames per second, for up to two hours on one battery charge. It's made of a rugged aluminum, and has an intense cooling system to keep it running even in the hot sun. Even the tripod is made of carbon fiber, so you can't destroy this thing if you try. The camera's minimum focusing distance is two feet, which makes Dennis particularly proud. ""We've been really focused on creating presence in the near field,"" he says. ""To have subjects within your arm's reach, to have close subjects to you... You really feel presence."" The Bison falls somewhere in the middle of the VR camera field, such as it exists right now. There are solutions like HypeVR , which amounts to an impossibly expensive and cumbersome set of super-high-end RED cameras rigged together for VR. Google has Jump , GoPro has Odyssey , Facebook has Surround 360 . (Bison, by the way, is probably closer to Surround 360 than any other single product.) They're all big, expensive, and mostly made of a bunch of individual cameras stitched together. On the other side are the super-simple 360 cameras, like the Ricoh Theta . Those aren't pro cameras by any stretch. Condition One seems to intend the Bison to be sort of the DSLR for VR; it's more compact and easier to use, but absolutely capable of making something Oscar-worthy. Part of Condition One's journey has involved learning what works, and what doesn't, in virtual reality filmmaking. Before getting into VR, Dennis was a longtime war photographer, so he tends to like to run and gun. But moving around is not exactly a delightful viewing experience in VR-it's more likely to make you sick. So even if it were possible (and it really isn't), it wouldn't make a lot of sense to try and make a shoulder-mounted or hand-held VR camera. But the Bison's close, at only 12.5 pounds. More important, it's rugged enough to go the places you'll want to put it; Dennis has watched as bison, jaguars, and (in a less-frightening shoot) monarch butterflies inspected the camera while he watched from afar. The remote trigger works from a half-mile away, too, so you can keep yourself out of your spherical shot and still get the footage you need. As they worked, Dennis says, they found that the hardest part wasn't the shooting-it was the stitching. Taking a bunch of cameras, and putting all their images together in a way that looks right, is hard and intensive work. The best solutions will make everything seamless, literally and figuratively, and making their own hardware made it easier to build the necessary software too. Now they're trying to figure out what kinds of VR movies people want to watch. And where to put them so people can see them. And how to make money. Right now, in VR, if you solve one problem all you get is a hundred new ones to figure out. More than just about anything you own, your smartphone represents you. Your photos, your communications, your work, your leisure activities, your nudes, everything's in this one rectangular piece of metal and glass. You smartphone, therefore you are. Google is pushing the boundaries of what a case can do to and with your phone, and is obviously committed to a deep sense of personalization and identity with phones. As our phones come to contain our personalities, a good case becomes all the more important. Not only does it keep your phone from shattering on the sidewalk and taking all your memories and plans with it, it turns your phone into something that looks and feels more unique. More personal. More you. Google's taking the idea even further, introducing a new Live Case Creator tool that lets you turn a point on a map or a photo into a phone case you can slap on the back of your Nexus 6 , 6P , or 5X . You go to the creator website, and upload a photo or use the Google Maps interface to select a location. Then, position it on the case however you want, select among Google's many filters, which add color or transmogrify your photo into an abstract art piece. Confirm it, buy it, and Google prints and ships you a case of your very own. Maybe coolest of all, these Live Cases skin the wallpaper of your phone to match your new case. If you go with the map, you can turn your wallpaper into a similarly colored, moving map of where you are right now. If you choose a picture, you can make an album of other shots for your phone to style and switch between automatically. There's also a button on the back of each case that will launch your phone's camera (if you choose a photo case) or find you nearby places in Maps (if you pick a location). Google first hinted at plans like this when it worked with Skrillex on a handful of customized phone cases. Googlers say they were blown away by the response to that project, and that people wanted more. The company's pushing the boundaries of what a case can do to and with your phone, and is obviously committed to a deep sense of personalization and identity with phones. It's always been part of Google's vision for Android, right down to the tagline: be together. Not the same. Maybe before long picking a phone case won't be like choosing clothes from the rack, finding the garment that fits you most closely. It'll be more like making your own clothes, and getting it exactly right. If the rumors are correct, Apple is bringing back a smaller iPhone . This makes sense. There's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all smartphone or even a two-sizes-fit-all smartphone. Some people want a phone that fits in the pocket of their skinny jeans. Other people have larger-sized skinny jeans. A third group of slacks-wearing people want a phone the size of a skateboard deck. The same idea holds true for almost everything. Some people want big versions of things that are supposed to be small. Others want small versions of things that are supposed to be big. All of this is possible. On my desk right now, there's an oversized pencil, an undersized building, a miniature hockey player with a disproportionately large hockey stick, and a ""King Size"" Sharpie. Here is a photograph of these objects taken with my phone, which is the size of a skateboard deck: More often than not, things that aren't their appropriate size are whimsical and fun . On occasion, they're even thought-provoking. Examining an object that isn't normal-size lets you appreciate its form or design detached from its function. This will help you forget about taxes for a little while. Alas, acquiring miniature and oversized objects isn't as easy as walking into a store and heading to the ""giant"" or ""tiny"" section. Luckily, there are dedicated online outlets for each of these retail needs. For things that are smaller than normal size , perusing the digital aisles of Archie McPhee, Suck UK, and ThinkGeek is a good place to start. McPhee has items such as squirrel-size coffee cups and underpants , a functional miniature drum kit , and a tabletop ark of the covenant . Suck UK has you covered on the guitar-case lunchbox and planet-themed eraser fronts. ThinkGeek is the place to go if you want a miniature filing cabinet for your business cards or a tiny, functional Tesla coil . But those are all readymade products. If you want to create your own miniature projects, cruise by Mini Materials . It's like a Home Depot on the island of Blefuscu : miniature cinder blocks, shipping pallets, bricks, and two-by-fours. There are also tiny packets of concrete mix and minuscule buckets of mortar. For things that are larger than normal size , Archie McPhee is also a handy source, with things like giant googly eyes , a coffee cup that holds around two gallons , and a gigantic slice of toast you can sleep on. But again, if you want oversized stuff, it's best to go to an oversized-stuff specialist. GreatBigStuff.com is the titan of the market, offering mission-critical objects such as plus-size Whoopee Cushions , a flask that holds a gallon of whisky , a giant functional computer mouse , and a massive (and edible) Ferrero-Rocher candy . You can also buy a large stack of fake cash to use as a foot rest and an unlimited supply of oxygen for $1 . For things that are actual size , try all other stores. What if you could play a videogame with a banana? Or a drum machine with a burrito? MaKey MaKey lets you do exactly that-and more. MaKey Makey turns everyday objects into digital touchpads for your computer. Jay Silver and Eric Rosenbaum designed it while they were in grad school at MIT. Inspired by the maker movement, they wanted to create an open-ended way of getting people to think creatively about how kids interact with our increasingly networked world. The result is a clever kit that makes a controller of literally anything that conducts electricity. ""Makey Makey is a device for allowing people to plug the real world into their computers,"" said David Ten Have of JoyLabz, which produces the kit. ""We want people to be able to see the world as their construction kit. And basically the way MaKey MaKey works is that it pretends to be a USB keyboard."" Each kit comes with a circuit board-the heart of the kit-a set of alligator clips, and a USB cable that plugs into your computer. The USB provides power to the circuit board, and the alligator clips link the board to any object that conducts electricity. Turns out, a lot of things conduct electricity. Food. Plants. Play-Doh. Even you.""We were shooting for creating a product that had an incredibly low floor for participation, but an incredibly high ceiling for expression,"" said Ten Have. ""We're seeing things made as simple as a banana piano and as advanced as measuring tools for chemistry labs, for instance."" The possibilities seem endless. Kids can turn their art into an instrument. Connect the alligator clips to people's hands to make a human drum machine. People have transformed a trash can into a calculator and a slice of pizza into a game controller. Your garbage can is full of new controllers . Fresh air can be harder to come by than you might think. If you have pets or you live in a city or it's cold outside, you are almost certainly breathing air that is full of contaminants that can make you sick, and even trigger asthma and allergies. You can't do much about the air you breathe at work or on the train, but you can control the air inside your home. The problem is that most air purifiers are ugly, loud, and some even omit ozone-which can be a serious lung irritant. Airmega tackles all of those problems with the Smart Air Purifier , which is (reasonably) attractive, quiet, and doesn't spew toxins. It's also a smart appliance that's actually smart. The Airmega keeps you abreast of the air quality in your place, and an app (of course it's got an app) lets you know if the air's gotten funky while you're on the road. If so, simply activate it remotely and come home to fresh air. A handy automatic mode lets the purifier turn itself on whenever the air gets stale, and an eco-friendly mode shuts it off after 10 minutes. The machine has filters on two sides, so it inhales more bad air and exhales more good. This thing can renew the air in a 1,560 square foot space twice an hour. Airmega claims the carbon and HEPA filters remove 99.97 percent of the junk in the air, and the app (and a sensor on top of the device) tell you when it's time to change them. Airmega says they're good for a year. These things aren't cheap, though. The smaller model, the 300S, will cost $749 when it's available through Airmega and Amazon later this month. The larger 400S will run you $849. But then, how much are your lungs worth? A little over three years ago, the Popslate presented an intriguing idea: What if a case could turn the back of your phone into an E Ink display? Like a lot of first-generation, crowdsourced products, the original didn't quite live up to the promise. Popslate 2, though, looks like a very promising course correction. The original Popslate, which finally materialized last spring, worked as advertised. Its limitations, though, made it difficult to justify as an everyday case. It charged with a different cable than the iPhone 6 it was designed to fit, and at launch only displayed still images pushed from an app on the front of the phone. It eventually used IFTTT to prompt screen updates without manual intervention, but even that required a little bit more digital elbow grease-and a little less functionality-than might justify the added bulk and expense. Popslate 2 doesn't just promise to address these issues; it actively adds plenty of functionality as well. It's an evolution, not merely refinement. To start, Popslate 2 not only ditched microUSB for the Apple-preferred Lightning cable, the case itself provides a backup battery that can add up to nine hours of talk time (or four hours of browsing) to your iPhone. It manages to do so while still reducing the thickness versus the original Popslate by nearly half. The display itself has improved, as well. Still ""shatterproof,"" it's now 200 dpi versus the previous version's 115, and has a pleasant-looking curve to it. There's also an easy way to navigate the latest Popslate on the display itself. Three capacitive touch buttons at the bottom of the display let you switch between apps and scroll through content. More important than the hardware upgrades, though, are the software smarts Popslate has added. Rather than lean on static images and clumsy IFTTT integration, Popslate now pulls directly from a handful of useful apps to maintain a dynamic display. You still need to download and use the Popslate app to customize your black-and-white rear display, but your options have expanded. ""We are leveraging sources with APIs and pulling that content straight into the Popslate app,"" says co-founder Greg Moon. ""Planned integrations for launch are: NYT, Twitter, Accuweather, and Google Calendar. We are also putting together partnerships around sports and stocks, which likely will also be part of the launch."" Moon says the company determined what apps and areas to focus on based on people's IFTTT usage on the original Popslate. In addition to the news, weather, and social functions it has already has-and the sports and stocks to come-you can expect to see wearable and IoT data apps at some point as well. Popslate 2 also comes with a Wallet function that lets you display items with bar or QR codes, like boarding passes or concert tickets. That's not to say everything is perfect. While the ideal app might seem to be Kindle-reading E Ink beats reading on an LCD display any day-you won't find Amazon's e-reading software here. You can use Popslate 2 as an e-reader, but currently only through Project Gutenberg, a free e-book resource whose catalog features mostly public domain classics. While Moon wouldn't confirm if there were plans for Kindle down the road, he's confident that the e-book selection will expand. ""We are also in discussions with additional e-book providers,"" says Moon. ""Unfortunately we can't disclose the parties at present for confidentiality purposes. As a result, our e-book sources and supported formats (including EPUB) will expand substantially after launch."" The ""after launch"" part is the other small cause for concern. Like its forebear, Popslate 2 is a crowdfunded project. But while it's generally healthy to be skeptical of Indiegogo concepts, the fact that the Popslate team has already delivered once offers at least some confidence in the second generation. It's expected to ship this July, at a cost of $149 (or $69 for early backers). A second E Ink display isn't a new idea; a company called Yotaphone has even built one into the handset itself. But if Popslate 2 delivers the improvements it's promising, it will have made a pretty good product pretty great. Considering that the average smartphone user takes out their phone more than 220 times a day , you might want to invest in a nice case. Wood is generally prettier than plastic, and while there are a variety of wooden phone cases to choose from, most of them have some visible plastic or rubber that totally distracts from that outdoorsy vibe you're going for. Luckily, the Woodline case for iPhone 6 and 6s is made by Pad & Quill , has a 100 percent wooden exterior. OK, it's not all wood: Unless it was a quarter-inch thick, a totally wooden phone case would probably crack when dropped. The outer wooden shell is filled with Aramid fibers, the same stuff used on drumheads and jet engine enclosures. If you prefer keeping your phone in your pocket, the Woodline is ultra-thin so you can easily do so. Seriously: According to Pad & Quill, it's as thin as a dime, so it's definitely not going add any noticeable bulk. The cases are all handcrafted out of real wood, so each one looks different and is engraved by the carpenter who made it. The cases come in four different types of wood: American Cherry, Rosewood, Zebra, or American Walnut, so you can pick the grain that most suits your daily grind. The case is currently available for preorder and will begin shipping next week. Raspberry Pi, the computer that literally fits in the palm of your hand, isn't for everyone. It comes with circuitry exposed, without a case, input method, or, until now, much in the way of connectivity. With the addition of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, though, Raspberry Pi 3 comes closer to a pocketable PC for everyone. The third generation of Raspberry Pi in its four years of existence, Raspberry Pi 3 integrates 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. Previously, you had to employ some dongle magic to add that functionality. The only other big upgrade-there are, after all, only so many components to upgrade-is the processor. Where previously sat a 900MHz 32-bit, quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU now sits a 1.2GHz 64-bit, quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU. If those numbers mean nothing to you, just know that it's about 10x the performance of the original Raspberry Pi, and over 50 percent better than the previous iteration. Otherwise, the Pi remains largely the same. It's roughly the same size and shape as generations past, aside from some minor component shuffling to accommodate the antenna that allows for its newfound wireless connectivity. Most importantly, it's holding on to that $35 price. For the cost of a few decent deli sandwiches, you can still own a fully functional (and now, even more so) pint-sized computer. It's important, too, that Raspberry Pi keep building on its success. No shortage of micro-computer competitors have sprung up in the years since the original Pi's introduction, some of which, like the Arduino 101, have already either promised or delivered an advanced feature set. And for three or four times the price of a Pi 3, consumers can opt for a ""PC on a Stick"" dongle, like Lenovo's Ideacentre Stick or Intel's Compute Stick, that offers the convenience of a dongle form factor, and the ability to plug directly into a monitor. Nobody's done it better for longer, though, than the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It still takes a little bit of know-how to fit it into your life, but one of the best bargains in tech is even more so now. Today Oculus Rift unveiled three new VR-ready PCs that excited, ready-to-be-completely-immersed gamers can pre-order in one week. The new PC towers, from Dell, Alienware, and ASUS, are designed to handle the powerful new VR graphics, which take a massive amount of rendering power to bring games to life in your headset. To no one's surprise, they don't come cheap. Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,500 for a Oculus Rift-ready PC-but if you were one of the enthusiasts that pre-ordered Rift, you may be eligible for a discount. And if you already own a super computer, there's a chance that it might already be Rift-friendly already. You can test with Oculus's compatibility tool , which you have to download so it can scan your system's current capabilities. A traditional 1080p game requires 124 million shaded pixels per second to render the visualizations. Oculus Rift's VR program needs about three times that rendering power. According to the company blog, a Rift runs at 2160x1200p on dual displays and requires somewhere in the range of 400 million shaded pixels per second. TL;DR, most computers are way too weak to run VR headsets. So what will people will be able to do with their new VR-ready PCs? Well considering Facebook acquired Oculus Rift for $2 billion dollars last year, and keeping in mind that the platform now counts over one billion users, the company is certainly poised to do big things. Oculus already boasts an impressive roster of immersive experiences, including porn , reading a book on a beach , or playing golf with robots . Keeping a journal is a pain in the ass. It's a scientifically-proven wonderful thing to do-to preserve your memories, explore your feelings, record the things you do and notice and care about-but it's a lot of work to sit down every day and get your Dear Diary on. Day One has always cleverly skirted that hassle by turning a journal entry into something more like a splits counter on a stopwatch. The app takes your location, motion data, and more, and turns it into a snapshot of your life at any time you choose. How you fill it out-or don't-with words, pictures, video, and whatever else, is then up to you. The app's been around for a few years for Mac and iPhone, but developer Bloom Built just released its first complete overhaul ever. The new Day One (insanely named Day One 2-yes, really) has a slicker design, a much bigger emphasis on photos, and a handful of new ways to filter your journal to see entries from a certain place or time or from a specific topic. You can even have multiple journals, in case you want to separate your obsessive cataloging of every book you read from your ""feelsy"" entries. The Mac app is a great browser for your old entries, and the iPhone app is well-tuned to make saving and creating those entries really easy. Just 3D-touch to start a new entry, snap or upload a photo, add a caption, and poof: You're a journaler. The app is also unusually good at giving you control over your privacy and data. You can set a passcode, and at any time export all your data to PDF or a plain text file. It's a lot more secure than hiding your journal underneath your mattress. Stomaching the price might be a little tough ($9.99 for the iPhone app, $39.99 for Mac, though if you buy right now it's half-off), but that's the hardest part. Everything else about keeping a journal will suddenly be a lot easier. More so than any kind of modern technology, digital cameras have pushed retro designs into the mainstream. Fujifilm , Nikon , Panasonic , and Olympus all have their own throwback shooters-and Leica has never really strayed from its timeless designs. It's not just a gimmick, either. In the world of photography, retro style is sensible: Unlike today's sleek, touchscreen-controlled phones and tablets, experienced photographers want to have all the knobs, buttons, and dials they need at their fingertips. The fetching Olympus PEN-F is the company's latest old-school camera, and it bears the same name and stylistic touches as Olympus' 35mm film SLR cameras from the early- to mid-1960s. While a tribute to a 35mm film camera would suggest the PEN-F has a full-frame sensor, that isn't the case. It's built around a Micro Four-Thirds sensor like the other cameras in the PEN series. This sensor's brand new, though. It's a 20-megapixel imager, bolstered by Olympus' excellent five-axis stabilization system. It also does the same cool things as Olympus' recent OMD series cameras. There's the ""Hi Res"" mode found in the OMD E-M5 Mark II , a tripod-optimized feature that moves the sensor around to capture a 50-megapixel shot. There's also the focus-bracketing feature found in the E-M5 II, E-M10, and E-M1. The PEN series usually bears lesser specs than Olympus' higher-end OMD lineup, but not this one. The PEN-F is basically an OMD-level camera in a throwback body. It captures continuous shots at a rate of up to 20fps, has a lightning-fast autofocus system, boasts shutter speeds up to 1/16,000 of a second, and shoots RAW. Video capture tops out 1080p at 60fps, although you're able to record time-lapse video in 4K at 5fps. For sure, the most compelling thing about this camera is its body. There's a distinct dial on the front that lets you toggle between monochrome, color, and filter effects. Up top, machined aluminum dials handle mode selections, shutter, and exposure compensation, while a heavy-duty scroll wheel on the back lets you dial everything in. This is also the first PEN camera with an eye-level viewfinder; the others only have a live-view LCD screen. And it's no half-assed EVF, as its OLED display has 2.36 million dots of resolution. But there's still a 3-inch flip-and swivel touchscreen on board, and like most cameras these days, Wi-Fi connectivity is built in. Those OMD-level specs in a PEN body come with a price to match, and you'll have to wait about a month to start shooting with it. The PEN-F will be available in early March, priced at $1,200 for the body only. It's compatible with Micro Four-Thirds system lenses-which have a bigger-than-most crop factor of 2x. Your phone is disgusting. I'm sorry, but it's true. It's covered in germs and... well, and worse . It also stays dirty, because you never clean it, because doing so would ruin it. Tricky situation! Tricky and gross. It's something that the Kyocera Digno Rafre looks to remedy. The Digno Rafre, available in Japan, has pretty basic specs for a smartphone; it starts at 16GB storage, has 2GB RAM, a 13MP rear and 2MP front-facing camera. It runs Android 5.1. None of that's enough to turn heads. For neat freaks, though, or those nonplussed by the thought of carrying around millions of bacteria in their pocket every day, it has one crucial advantage: you can wash it with soap. That's more impressive than it may sound. It's hard enough to find a waterproof smartphone today, and until now impossible to find one that can survive the rigors of a rigorous good scrubbing. In fact, even the Digno Rafre has its limits; Kyocera encourages the use of foam-based soap, rather than potentially injurious bars. Kyocera reportedly managed the feat by finding a better way to seal the device. The Digno Rafre's display also works when wet, meaning it may be the first handset targeted specifically at the bubble bath set. The phone's only available in Japan (for $467), and Kyocera has indicated they don't plan to sell it elsewhere. Until they change their minds-or someone else offers a washproof smartphone stateside-you can always opt for constantly wearing gloves, or obsessively washing your hands. Starting today, you can preorder the consumer version of the Gear VR headset for $99. Sure, Samsung's headset has been around for awhile, at least for developers and lucky beta testers who got their hands on the Innovator Edition. But this is the first time the Oculus Rift-powered headset has been sold to regular consumers. The devices will ship November 20. This isn't just some new packaging slapped on the earlier model: According to Oculus , the official Gear VR headset is 19 percent lighter and ""features improved ergonomics,"" like a new touchpad that should make it easier to use. The best news: Gear VR is going to work with more Samsung phones, and there are lots of new games to use it with. If you have a Galaxy S6 Edge, S6, Note 5, or S6 Edge+, you're in the clear (though the last two will require a carrier software update). And perhaps the most exciting new title on the horizon is , a visually stunning game set in an ancient civilization from the makers of Monument Valley . The Gear is just one of a few compelling VR headsets, but it's managed to situate itself nicely for user adoption by aggressively partnering with various media outlets to experiment with consumer VR experiences. Already we've watched NBA games and political debates. Oh yeah, and it's just under 100 bucks. You can order the Gear headset now on Amazon , Best Buy , or from Samsung . We've all done the ""pocket pat down"" to check we have our phones and wallets before leaving the house. But even if you remember to bring your phone with you, it'll be dead weight if you forget to charge it. Sure, you could always bring a spare charger in your bag, but if you like to go out with only the clothes on your back you know that pocket space is a limited resource. Nomad 's new Wallet for iPhone might be able to help all the bagless chumps out. As its name suggests, the Wallet is a battery pack for your iPhone-but it's no bulky charger: It's no thicker than a standard billfold wallet. It measures in at 95mm (height) x 125mm (width) x 25mm (max thickness), so feel free to stuff it with your disposable income and those fro-yo stamp cards. Nomad was able to keep these dimensions by placing the skinny, yet high powered, 2400 mAh battery along the spine of the Wallet. That's enough juice to fully charge an iPhone 6s. When the Wallet's battery is depleted, it can be recharged by any microUSB charger. Flashing indicator lights will tell you how much energy is stored in the Wallet, and when you are ready to connect it to your iPhone, you can un-sheath its built in Lightning cable. Considering that it can hold all these electronics, your cash, and your cards without looking like a lunchbox, that's some serious space optimization. The Wallet for iPhone can be pre-ordered now for $80 ($20 off retail), and is expected to ship November 15. Love the gaming style of arcades but the physicality of, you know, actually moving? This hack turns indoor rock climbing into a real life video game of sorts-and the creator of the code is working with various rock climbing gyms to bring it to their facilities. Maybe it will hit your local rock wall soon. I've watched the teaser video for the RoBoHoN a few times now, and I still don't know what to make of it. Sharp, who made it, calls it ""a phone in human shape, a phone that you feel like talking to."" The name itself is a wonky portmanteau of robot and phone. It can be held up next to your ear just like any other phone. Unlike any other phone, though, it is also a talking robot helper projector music toy assistant man. Sure! In the three-minute video, the RoBoHoN plays all sorts of roles. It waves happily at you when your alarm goes off, sits on your car dash, remembers to buy you more toothpaste in a squeaky anime voice, and then bends over at the waist to point its built-in projector at a table to show you photos from your boyfriend while he tells you how much he loves you while you cry, apparently? You can dress RoBoHoN up in a bunch of different accessories, including Swarovski crystals. He's mostly designed to be talked to, but he has a touchscreen on his back in case you need to touch him. On one hand, this is definitely the worst phone ever. You wear it by a lanyard around your neck, the screen is small and bad, and I mean, come on, the thing is huge and unwieldy and you look like you're holding a toy to your face. But the robot? The robot seems pretty great. RoBoHoN uses facial recognition to tell individual people to smile for the camera. He (I think it's a he? I've been saying ""he"" but it's entirely possible that RoBoHoN exists outside of gender) will help you remember to do stuff; he'll help your kid learn to walk; he'll play music and literally lead the dance party. He can sit, walk, hail cabs, and do a thousand other crazy things. The concept video looks like an out-there student film, or a live-action cut of something Pixar might be working on. But Sharp swears RoBoHoN is a real thing, set for launch next year. In the inevitable army of the robot takeover, this is the one that eats your smartphone. And dammit if it's not just the cutest little everything machine. There's absolutely no reason that your every day computer shouldn't look like an F-22 cockpit simulation. That seems to be the logic behind HP's new 34-inch Curved All-in-One, an impossibly long display that can comfortably accommodate more tabs than is healthy. The shape's not new to HP; the company already sells a 34-inch display that looks basically identical. The resolution isn't as eye-popping as, say, a 5K iMac, but a 5K iMac doesn't curve, or cover nearly three feet of ground, diagonally. Now, though, HP has stuffed a computer inside that display, in a glorious act of why not? Inside, you'll find substantial enough guts: The $1,799 base model comes with the latest Core i5 processor and 8GB of memory, and you can upgrade to as much as 2TB of storage, 16GB RAM, and a discrete Nvidia GTX 960A graphics card. All of which is to say it'll do pretty much whatever you might need it to. Most importantly, though, it is gigantic; a multi-monitor set-up that requires just one glorious monitor. It's even, one might venture, innovative, at a time that the PC industry desperately needs innovation . It'll be available Nov. 8, and while it's obviously intended for those with specific needs and muscular budget, the rest of us can at least appreciate a heaping desktop helping of eye candy when we see it. Keurig Kold, a countertop soda-making machine that Keurig hopes will expand its appeal beyond coffee. Keurig, best known for its pod-based, countertop coffee dispensers, is branching out. The new Keurig Kold provides a chilled counterpoint to the company's previous models, serving up sodas from name-brand pod providers like Coca-Cola and Snapple. If that sounds a bit like SodaStream, that's because it is, although there are a few key differences. The most important of which, for those who've grown weary of carbon dioxide refills, is that Kold uses ""Karbonator beads"" embedded in its pods to generate CO2. That means no canisters, and no confusion over just how many bubbles to add. That also means the Kold should be equally adept at non-carbonated beverages, including teas, sports drinks, and flavored water; in addition to its partners, Keurig will be offering its own brands in those categories. Regardless of fizz, as you'd expect from the name, the drinks also come out, well, cold, thanks to what Keurig describes as an ""aerospace-inspired thermal transfer system."" While it's hitting shelves today-or more specifically, hitting Keurig's retail website; it will roll out to stores in select cities later this month-Kold made its debut at an analyst conference this past March, and has been in development the past five years. The long rollout signifies just how important Kold is to Keurig; the company's currently trading at about a third of its 52-week high due to quickly fading sales of its K-Cup-based coffee products, a decline that led the company to announce a 5 percent workforce reduction in August. Kold represents its best chance at a pick-me-up. Then again, Kold's most obvious competition, SodaStream, has been in an extended sales free fall, calling into question whether there's currently a significant market for home carbonation machines in the first place. The device faces other challenges, as well. A coffee pod's prime appeal is ease of use; it's obviously faster and less fussy than parsing out grinds for a traditional drip coffee maker. Making that same case for Kold could be tricky, since it's competing against the simple act of popping the tab on a can, or twisting the top of a bottle. And whatever convenience it does offer doesn't come cheap; Kold comes with an MSRP of $370, with pods costing between $4.50 and $5.00 for a pack of four. Each pod produces a single 8-ounce drink, making your countertop cola more expensive than the grocery store equivalent even before the sunk cost of the machine itself. Push-button drink production has a demonstrable appeal; whether that translates from hot to cold depends on one's counter space, pod appeal, and single-serve obsession. The tablet industry is still going strong, but if we can take away anything from the Microsoft Surface and iPad Pro releases, it's that some people really want keyboards to go with their tablets. Built-in touch screen keyboards simply aren't enough for writing anything longer than a text, and they take up valuable screen space. The thin screen-protector-like keyboards that Microsoft and Apple make are great for portability, but they don't offer the tactile feel that desktop keyboards do. If you want a keyboard that feels awesome (and isn't that portable) what better place to look for inspiration than a good old-fashion typewriter? The folks at Qwerkytoys have created the Qwerkywriter , a tablet keyboard that mimics the look and feel of a typewriter. Even though the Qwerkywriter looks old fashioned, there's plenty of modern tech baked inside. The keyboard pairs with devices via Bluetooth, so even though it has a dock that fits all sorts of tablets, it can be paired with smartphones or even desktop computers. Additionally, that macro return bar isn't just for show: By default, it doubles as an enter key, but can also be programmed to render up to five characters. The Qwerkywriter started as a Kickstarter campaign, but since it already met its goal of $90,000, you can pre-order it now for $329. The pre-orders won't ship out until October or November, but in the meantime you can listen to the satisfying clicks of the Qwerky's keys in action. The maximum load of a PhunkeeDuck-or any other brand of these suddenly popular stand-up scooter boards -is around 300 pounds. The maximum thing you should try to do on one of them is not to fall over. Somehow, personal trainer Bradley Martyn stepped onto one, stuck 315 pounds behind his neck (six 45-pound weights plus a 45-pound bar), and blasted some squats. Four reps, bro. On a spaceboard, bro. This is dangerous, and you should not ever try it. In fact, you can hear the stand-up scooter crack during the initial squat, and again during the fourth rep. Somehow, the contraption held together during the entire feat of strength and balance, and that wasn't the only danger to Martyn's safety. Fall backward, and risk a concussion from the back of your head smacking a solid steel bar. Fall forward, and risk your face being pinned to the floor by 315 pounds. So never attempt this superhuman show of agility, even if you look like He-Man. Still, feel free to watch it repeatedly on the Internet to your heart's desire. Logitech G is launching two new gaming headphones: the G633 and G933 Artemis Spectrum. They are the result of Logitech's sound engineering team's attempt to create a gaming headset that delivers audio comparable to top-shelf headphones. With patent pending Pro-G audio drivers and 7.1 Dolby surround sound, these headphones aim to immerse you into the game. The two headphones look similar, with the G933 as the beefier big brother. The G933 includes a few more features than the G633, such as the ability to operate wirelessly and an additional audio input for sound mixing. But you'll have to pay a little bit more to get these extras, as the G933 costs $200 versus the G633's $150 price tag. Regardless, the two both offer some cool customizable features. By downloading the Logitech Gaming Software, you are able to assign game macro functions to the headset's three programmable G-keys. Additionally, you can use the software to adjust equalizer settings and set up sound profiles that best fit your acoustic preferences. On the other hand, some customizable features are just for fun, like the ability to change the RGB lighting to any color of your choosing. Look out for the Logitech G633 and G933 Artemis Spectrum in October 2015. While your smartphone is an easy conduit for all-emoji conversation, things get a little tough when you find yourself at a regular old laptop. Sure, keyboard shortcuts can get you there, but PC-made discussion is still dominated by... you know, words. Until now! Emoji Key is a set of stickers you can throw on top of your lettered keyboard. Then you just have to install the emoji keyboard on your laptop (the site includes instructions), and boom: You are typing in nothing but emoji. And yes, this would probably get confusing eventually. In Samsung's never-ending quest to take on the iPhone, it's giving customers the chance to test drive one of its Galaxy phones (the S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, or Note 5) for 30 days for the low, low price of $1. If you're an iPhone user who's curious about the competition, now is the time to question your allegiance. You'll get a month's worth of data, and since it's not like you have to hand your iPhone over to Samsung, you've essentially got two phones for a month. For a data hog, that's not a bad deal. Really, this should have become a standard a long time ago. According to Reuters , this surfer shelled out $390 to attach a device to his board that emits ""an electronic force field that overpowers [sharks'] sensing organs."" Sounds like the best $390 he ever spent. There are couple of retailers installing these devices, including SurfSafe and SharkShield -check out this video from the former showing you how its done.",en

You obviously had to be logged into AIM, with just the right away message that told your real friends you were still nearby (and you better not skimp on your buddy profile). But you couldn't ignore your MySpace IM or Yahoo Messenger, just in case your maybe-real Internet crushes wanted to chat. And you gotta keep up your nerd cred on IRC. Being popular was hard work! Franz is a free app that combines more than a dozen different messaging services into a single window. Now, though, technology has become more sophisticated and user-friendly. And as messaging has become a key component of how we do almost everything online, our interaction with chat is easy and understandable part of our everyday lives. Wait, no, that's wrong. It's the exact opposite. Messaging is more important, more powerful, and more versatile, and yet wrangling all of our constant conversations together is like herding cats. Except there are a thousand cats, and they're all rabid and loud and running in every direction as fast as they possibly can while meowing horribly offensive things about all the other cats and giving you really important work deadlines. It's not a pretty picture. Years ago, apps like Adium, Meebo, and Trillian quickly became a crucial part of every Internet Socialite's arsenal. All your accounts in one place, neatly organized, so you could remember who's who and what's where at all times. There's nothing like that now, and there really couldn't be; messaging apps are more than just text-sending protocols, they're entire platforms. Every platform is different, and there's no way to neatly combine them. The best we can hope for is to at least bring all those disparate things into one place, which is exactly what Franz does. Franz is a new-ish free app for Mac, Windows, and Linux, that combines more than a dozen different messaging services into a single window. When you open Franz, you can instantly be logged into Slack, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Skype, Hangouts, and more. The app itself is just a container-you're basically opening web views of all the apps, tabbed in a single lovely window. By combining them into one place, though, you get a single set of notifications for all your services. A little red ""1"" will show up next to anything with an unread message, so you know at a glance what's waiting for you. And best of all, you're not stuck switching between a dozen browser tabs or a folder full of apps. Even though you don't, it feels like you have just one messaging app. It's just Franz. Franz isn't a perfect, universal messaging solution. It's not Adium 2.0. But it's the closest thing we're probably ever going to get. As the messaging ecosystem metastasizes and becomes the universal interface for how we do everything, easy access to our many tools is much more realistic than trying to build a single Megazord Messenger that encompasses them all. And besides, this might be better anyway. You get Slack the way it's meant to be used, and with a single key command you're jumping into Facebook's most complete vision of Messenger. Until we get that universal messaging app that would make life so much easier, this is definitely the next best thing. If you bought a Sony or Sharp TV from the past couple of years and you have an iPhone, you've got yourself a new way to navigate your smartwares. At long last, Google's Android TV Remote app is now available in the iOS App Store. It replicates the functionality of the same app for Android , which has been available for years. The most useful function of the app is its double-duty microphone/keyboard feature The remote-control app for Android TV devices isn't all that full-featured-it's essentially just an app version of the plastic remote included with the Google Nexus Player . Regardless, it's a handy backup clicker or a back-from-the-dead use case for an old iPod Touch. You've got your D-pad for navigating menus. Got that home button right there, too. Back button? Check. Even has an icon on there for a-playin' and a-pausin', and you can turn the whole screen into a touchpad like some kind of weirdo. But the most useful function of the app is its double-duty microphone/keyboard feature. You can use your phone as a mouthpiece for Android TV's excellent voice search (hopefully Siri won't get jealous). The app one-ups the Nexus remote by letting you input text with your phone's touchscreen keyboard. Plus, it communicates to your TV or set-top device over Wi-Fi, so you don't need a line-of-sight connection. And yo, it's free. This week at the NAB Show , the annual trade show for people who make video content, virtual reality is going to be everywhere. Condition One , a startup-slash-studio that was earlier to VR filmmaking than most, is making one of the show's early announcements: a new VR camera called the Bison. This 360 rig is made for the kind of run-and-gun documentary shooting the company's known for. Or at least the closest you can get to that given the current state of VR tech. It won't be for sale, but it will be part of the company's toolkit as it continues to make VR movies-so if you want footage from the camera, you have to hire Condition One to shoot it. Here's the rundown on the camera itself: The Bison is named for the first thing Condition One founder Danfung Dennis shot with the initial prototype. It's comprised of 16 cameras, and all together they're capable of shooting full 360-degree video with full 3D audio. It'll produce 5.7K resolution video, at up to 48 frames per second, for up to two hours on one battery charge. It's made of a rugged aluminum, and has an intense cooling system to keep it running even in the hot sun. Even the tripod is made of carbon fiber, so you can't destroy this thing if you try. The camera's minimum focusing distance is two feet, which makes Dennis particularly proud. ""We've been really focused on creating presence in the near field,"" he says. ""To have subjects within your arm's reach, to have close subjects to you... You really feel presence."" The Bison falls somewhere in the middle of the VR camera field, such as it exists right now. There are solutions like HypeVR , which amounts to an impossibly expensive and cumbersome set of super-high-end RED cameras rigged together for VR. Google has Jump , GoPro has Odyssey , Facebook has Surround 360 . (Bison, by the way, is probably closer to Surround 360 than any other single product.) They're all big, expensive, and mostly made of a bunch of individual cameras stitched together. On the other side are the super-simple 360 cameras, like the Ricoh Theta . Those aren't pro cameras by any stretch. Condition One seems to intend the Bison to be sort of the DSLR for VR; it's more compact and easier to use, but absolutely capable of making something Oscar-worthy. Part of Condition One's journey has involved learning what works, and what doesn't, in virtual reality filmmaking. Before getting into VR, Dennis was a longtime war photographer, so he tends to like to run and gun. But moving around is not exactly a delightful viewing experience in VR-it's more likely to make you sick. So even if it were possible (and it really isn't), it wouldn't make a lot of sense to try and make a shoulder-mounted or hand-held VR camera. But the Bison's close, at only 12.5 pounds. More important, it's rugged enough to go the places you'll want to put it; Dennis has watched as bison, jaguars, and (in a less-frightening shoot) monarch butterflies inspected the camera while he watched from afar. The remote trigger works from a half-mile away, too, so you can keep yourself out of your spherical shot and still get the footage you need. As they worked, Dennis says, they found that the hardest part wasn't the shooting-it was the stitching. Taking a bunch of cameras, and putting all their images together in a way that looks right, is hard and intensive work. The best solutions will make everything seamless, literally and figuratively, and making their own hardware made it easier to build the necessary software too. Now they're trying to figure out what kinds of VR movies people want to watch. And where to put them so people can see them. And how to make money. Right now, in VR, if you solve one problem all you get is a hundred new ones to figure out. More than just about anything you own, your smartphone represents you. Your photos, your communications, your work, your leisure activities, your nudes, everything's in this one rectangular piece of metal and glass. You smartphone, therefore you are. Google is pushing the boundaries of what a case can do to and with your phone, and is obviously committed to a deep sense of personalization and identity with phones. As our phones come to contain our personalities, a good case becomes all the more important. Not only does it keep your phone from shattering on the sidewalk and taking all your memories and plans with it, it turns your phone into something that looks and feels more unique. More personal. More you. Google's taking the idea even further, introducing a new Live Case Creator tool that lets you turn a point on a map or a photo into a phone case you can slap on the back of your Nexus 6 , 6P , or 5X . You go to the creator website, and upload a photo or use the Google Maps interface to select a location. Then, position it on the case however you want, select among Google's many filters, which add color or transmogrify your photo into an abstract art piece. Confirm it, buy it, and Google prints and ships you a case of your very own. Maybe coolest of all, these Live Cases skin the wallpaper of your phone to match your new case. If you go with the map, you can turn your wallpaper into a similarly colored, moving map of where you are right now. If you choose a picture, you can make an album of other shots for your phone to style and switch between automatically. There's also a button on the back of each case that will launch your phone's camera (if you choose a photo case) or find you nearby places in Maps (if you pick a location). Google first hinted at plans like this when it worked with Skrillex on a handful of customized phone cases. Googlers say they were blown away by the response to that project, and that people wanted more. The company's pushing the boundaries of what a case can do to and with your phone, and is obviously committed to a deep sense of personalization and identity with phones. It's always been part of Google's vision for Android, right down to the tagline: be together. Not the same. Maybe before long picking a phone case won't be like choosing clothes from the rack, finding the garment that fits you most closely. It'll be more like making your own clothes, and getting it exactly right. If the rumors are correct, Apple is bringing back a smaller iPhone . This makes sense. There's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all smartphone or even a two-sizes-fit-all smartphone. Some people want a phone that fits in the pocket of their skinny jeans. Other people have larger-sized skinny jeans. A third group of slacks-wearing people want a phone the size of a skateboard deck. The same idea holds true for almost everything. Some people want big versions of things that are supposed to be small. Others want small versions of things that are supposed to be big. All of this is possible. On my desk right now, there's an oversized pencil, an undersized building, a miniature hockey player with a disproportionately large hockey stick, and a ""King Size"" Sharpie. Here is a photograph of these objects taken with my phone, which is the size of a skateboard deck: More often than not, things that aren't their appropriate size are whimsical and fun . On occasion, they're even thought-provoking. Examining an object that isn't normal-size lets you appreciate its form or design detached from its function. This will help you forget about taxes for a little while. Alas, acquiring miniature and oversized objects isn't as easy as walking into a store and heading to the ""giant"" or ""tiny"" section. Luckily, there are dedicated online outlets for each of these retail needs. For things that are smaller than normal size , perusing the digital aisles of Archie McPhee, Suck UK, and ThinkGeek is a good place to start. McPhee has items such as squirrel-size coffee cups and underpants , a functional miniature drum kit , and a tabletop ark of the covenant . Suck UK has you covered on the guitar-case lunchbox and planet-themed eraser fronts. ThinkGeek is the place to go if you want a miniature filing cabinet for your business cards or a tiny, functional Tesla coil . But those are all readymade products. If you want to create your own miniature projects, cruise by Mini Materials . It's like a Home Depot on the island of Blefuscu : miniature cinder blocks, shipping pallets, bricks, and two-by-fours. There are also tiny packets of concrete mix and minuscule buckets of mortar. For things that are larger than normal size , Archie McPhee is also a handy source, with things like giant googly eyes , a coffee cup that holds around two gallons , and a gigantic slice of toast you can sleep on. But again, if you want oversized stuff, it's best to go to an oversized-stuff specialist. GreatBigStuff.com is the titan of the market, offering mission-critical objects such as plus-size Whoopee Cushions , a flask that holds a gallon of whisky , a giant functional computer mouse , and a massive (and edible) Ferrero-Rocher candy . You can also buy a large stack of fake cash to use as a foot rest and an unlimited supply of oxygen for $1 . For things that are actual size , try all other stores. What if you could play a videogame with a banana? Or a drum machine with a burrito? MaKey MaKey lets you do exactly that-and more. MaKey Makey turns everyday objects into digital touchpads for your computer. Jay Silver and Eric Rosenbaum designed it while they were in grad school at MIT. Inspired by the maker movement, they wanted to create an open-ended way of getting people to think creatively about how kids interact with our increasingly networked world. The result is a clever kit that makes a controller of literally anything that conducts electricity. ""Makey Makey is a device for allowing people to plug the real world into their computers,"" said David Ten Have of JoyLabz, which produces the kit. ""We want people to be able to see the world as their construction kit. And basically the way MaKey MaKey works is that it pretends to be a USB keyboard."" Each kit comes with a circuit board-the heart of the kit-a set of alligator clips, and a USB cable that plugs into your computer. The USB provides power to the circuit board, and the alligator clips link the board to any object that conducts electricity. Turns out, a lot of things conduct electricity. Food. Plants. Play-Doh. Even you.""We were shooting for creating a product that had an incredibly low floor for participation, but an incredibly high ceiling for expression,"" said Ten Have. ""We're seeing things made as simple as a banana piano and as advanced as measuring tools for chemistry labs, for instance."" The possibilities seem endless. Kids can turn their art into an instrument. Connect the alligator clips to people's hands to make a human drum machine. People have transformed a trash can into a calculator and a slice of pizza into a game controller. Your garbage can is full of new controllers . Fresh air can be harder to come by than you might think. If you have pets or you live in a city or it's cold outside, you are almost certainly breathing air that is full of contaminants that can make you sick, and even trigger asthma and allergies. You can't do much about the air you breathe at work or on the train, but you can control the air inside your home. The problem is that most air purifiers are ugly, loud, and some even omit ozone-which can be a serious lung irritant. Airmega tackles all of those problems with the Smart Air Purifier , which is (reasonably) attractive, quiet, and doesn't spew toxins. It's also a smart appliance that's actually smart. The Airmega keeps you abreast of the air quality in your place, and an app (of course it's got an app) lets you know if the air's gotten funky while you're on the road. If so, simply activate it remotely and come home to fresh air. A handy automatic mode lets the purifier turn itself on whenever the air gets stale, and an eco-friendly mode shuts it off after 10 minutes. The machine has filters on two sides, so it inhales more bad air and exhales more good. This thing can renew the air in a 1,560 square foot space twice an hour. Airmega claims the carbon and HEPA filters remove 99.97 percent of the junk in the air, and the app (and a sensor on top of the device) tell you when it's time to change them. Airmega says they're good for a year. These things aren't cheap, though. The smaller model, the 300S, will cost $749 when it's available through Airmega and Amazon later this month. The larger 400S will run you $849. But then, how much are your lungs worth? A little over three years ago, the Popslate presented an intriguing idea: What if a case could turn the back of your phone into an E Ink display? Like a lot of first-generation, crowdsourced products, the original didn't quite live up to the promise. Popslate 2, though, looks like a very promising course correction. The original Popslate, which finally materialized last spring, worked as advertised. Its limitations, though, made it difficult to justify as an everyday case. It charged with a different cable than the iPhone 6 it was designed to fit, and at launch only displayed still images pushed from an app on the front of the phone. It eventually used IFTTT to prompt screen updates without manual intervention, but even that required a little bit more digital elbow grease-and a little less functionality-than might justify the added bulk and expense. Popslate 2 doesn't just promise to address these issues; it actively adds plenty of functionality as well. It's an evolution, not merely refinement. To start, Popslate 2 not only ditched microUSB for the Apple-preferred Lightning cable, the case itself provides a backup battery that can add up to nine hours of talk time (or four hours of browsing) to your iPhone. It manages to do so while still reducing the thickness versus the original Popslate by nearly half. The display itself has improved, as well. Still ""shatterproof,"" it's now 200 dpi versus the previous version's 115, and has a pleasant-looking curve to it. There's also an easy way to navigate the latest Popslate on the display itself. Three capacitive touch buttons at the bottom of the display let you switch between apps and scroll through content. More important than the hardware upgrades, though, are the software smarts Popslate has added. Rather than lean on static images and clumsy IFTTT integration, Popslate now pulls directly from a handful of useful apps to maintain a dynamic display. You still need to download and use the Popslate app to customize your black-and-white rear display, but your options have expanded. ""We are leveraging sources with APIs and pulling that content straight into the Popslate app,"" says co-founder Greg Moon. ""Planned integrations for launch are: NYT, Twitter, Accuweather, and Google Calendar. We are also putting together partnerships around sports and stocks, which likely will also be part of the launch."" Moon says the company determined what apps and areas to focus on based on people's IFTTT usage on the original Popslate. In addition to the news, weather, and social functions it has already has-and the sports and stocks to come-you can expect to see wearable and IoT data apps at some point as well. Popslate 2 also comes with a Wallet function that lets you display items with bar or QR codes, like boarding passes or concert tickets. That's not to say everything is perfect. While the ideal app might seem to be Kindle-reading E Ink beats reading on an LCD display any day-you won't find Amazon's e-reading software here. You can use Popslate 2 as an e-reader, but currently only through Project Gutenberg, a free e-book resource whose catalog features mostly public domain classics. While Moon wouldn't confirm if there were plans for Kindle down the road, he's confident that the e-book selection will expand. ""We are also in discussions with additional e-book providers,"" says Moon. ""Unfortunately we can't disclose the parties at present for confidentiality purposes. As a result, our e-book sources and supported formats (including EPUB) will expand substantially after launch."" The ""after launch"" part is the other small cause for concern. Like its forebear, Popslate 2 is a crowdfunded project. But while it's generally healthy to be skeptical of Indiegogo concepts, the fact that the Popslate team has already delivered once offers at least some confidence in the second generation. It's expected to ship this July, at a cost of $149 (or $69 for early backers). A second E Ink display isn't a new idea; a company called Yotaphone has even built one into the handset itself. But if Popslate 2 delivers the improvements it's promising, it will have made a pretty good product pretty great. Considering that the average smartphone user takes out their phone more than 220 times a day , you might want to invest in a nice case. Wood is generally prettier than plastic, and while there are a variety of wooden phone cases to choose from, most of them have some visible plastic or rubber that totally distracts from that outdoorsy vibe you're going for. Luckily, the Woodline case for iPhone 6 and 6s is made by Pad & Quill , has a 100 percent wooden exterior. OK, it's not all wood: Unless it was a quarter-inch thick, a totally wooden phone case would probably crack when dropped. The outer wooden shell is filled with Aramid fibers, the same stuff used on drumheads and jet engine enclosures. If you prefer keeping your phone in your pocket, the Woodline is ultra-thin so you can easily do so. Seriously: According to Pad & Quill, it's as thin as a dime, so it's definitely not going add any noticeable bulk. The cases are all handcrafted out of real wood, so each one looks different and is engraved by the carpenter who made it. The cases come in four different types of wood: American Cherry, Rosewood, Zebra, or American Walnut, so you can pick the grain that most suits your daily grind. The case is currently available for preorder and will begin shipping next week. Raspberry Pi, the computer that literally fits in the palm of your hand, isn't for everyone. It comes with circuitry exposed, without a case, input method, or, until now, much in the way of connectivity. With the addition of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, though, Raspberry Pi 3 comes closer to a pocketable PC for everyone. The third generation of Raspberry Pi in its four years of existence, Raspberry Pi 3 integrates 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. Previously, you had to employ some dongle magic to add that functionality. The only other big upgrade-there are, after all, only so many components to upgrade-is the processor. Where previously sat a 900MHz 32-bit, quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU now sits a 1.2GHz 64-bit, quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU. If those numbers mean nothing to you, just know that it's about 10x the performance of the original Raspberry Pi, and over 50 percent better than the previous iteration. Otherwise, the Pi remains largely the same. It's roughly the same size and shape as generations past, aside from some minor component shuffling to accommodate the antenna that allows for its newfound wireless connectivity. Most importantly, it's holding on to that $35 price. For the cost of a few decent deli sandwiches, you can still own a fully functional (and now, even more so) pint-sized computer. It's important, too, that Raspberry Pi keep building on its success. No shortage of micro-computer competitors have sprung up in the years since the original Pi's introduction, some of which, like the Arduino 101, have already either promised or delivered an advanced feature set. And for three or four times the price of a Pi 3, consumers can opt for a ""PC on a Stick"" dongle, like Lenovo's Ideacentre Stick or Intel's Compute Stick, that offers the convenience of a dongle form factor, and the ability to plug directly into a monitor. Nobody's done it better for longer, though, than the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It still takes a little bit of know-how to fit it into your life, but one of the best bargains in tech is even more so now. Today Oculus Rift unveiled three new VR-ready PCs that excited, ready-to-be-completely-immersed gamers can pre-order in one week. The new PC towers, from Dell, Alienware, and ASUS, are designed to handle the powerful new VR graphics, which take a massive amount of rendering power to bring games to life in your headset. To no one's surprise, they don't come cheap. Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,500 for a Oculus Rift-ready PC-but if you were one of the enthusiasts that pre-ordered Rift, you may be eligible for a discount. And if you already own a super computer, there's a chance that it might already be Rift-friendly already. You can test with Oculus's compatibility tool , which you have to download so it can scan your system's current capabilities. A traditional 1080p game requires 124 million shaded pixels per second to render the visualizations. Oculus Rift's VR program needs about three times that rendering power. According to the company blog, a Rift runs at 2160x1200p on dual displays and requires somewhere in the range of 400 million shaded pixels per second. TL;DR, most computers are way too weak to run VR headsets. So what will people will be able to do with their new VR-ready PCs? Well considering Facebook acquired Oculus Rift for $2 billion dollars last year, and keeping in mind that the platform now counts over one billion users, the company is certainly poised to do big things. Oculus already boasts an impressive roster of immersive experiences, including porn , reading a book on a beach , or playing golf with robots . Keeping a journal is a pain in the ass. It's a scientifically-proven wonderful thing to do-to preserve your memories, explore your feelings, record the things you do and notice and care about-but it's a lot of work to sit down every day and get your Dear Diary on. Day One has always cleverly skirted that hassle by turning a journal entry into something more like a splits counter on a stopwatch. The app takes your location, motion data, and more, and turns it into a snapshot of your life at any time you choose. How you fill it out-or don't-with words, pictures, video, and whatever else, is then up to you. The app's been around for a few years for Mac and iPhone, but developer Bloom Built just released its first complete overhaul ever. The new Day One (insanely named Day One 2-yes, really) has a slicker design, a much bigger emphasis on photos, and a handful of new ways to filter your journal to see entries from a certain place or time or from a specific topic. You can even have multiple journals, in case you want to separate your obsessive cataloging of every book you read from your ""feelsy"" entries. The Mac app is a great browser for your old entries, and the iPhone app is well-tuned to make saving and creating those entries really easy. Just 3D-touch to start a new entry, snap or upload a photo, add a caption, and poof: You're a journaler. The app is also unusually good at giving you control over your privacy and data. You can set a passcode, and at any time export all your data to PDF or a plain text file. It's a lot more secure than hiding your journal underneath your mattress. Stomaching the price might be a little tough ($9.99 for the iPhone app, $39.99 for Mac, though if you buy right now it's half-off), but that's the hardest part. Everything else about keeping a journal will suddenly be a lot easier. More so than any kind of modern technology, digital cameras have pushed retro designs into the mainstream. Fujifilm , Nikon , Panasonic , and Olympus all have their own throwback shooters-and Leica has never really strayed from its timeless designs. It's not just a gimmick, either. In the world of photography, retro style is sensible: Unlike today's sleek, touchscreen-controlled phones and tablets, experienced photographers want to have all the knobs, buttons, and dials they need at their fingertips. The fetching Olympus PEN-F is the company's latest old-school camera, and it bears the same name and stylistic touches as Olympus' 35mm film SLR cameras from the early- to mid-1960s. While a tribute to a 35mm film camera would suggest the PEN-F has a full-frame sensor, that isn't the case. It's built around a Micro Four-Thirds sensor like the other cameras in the PEN series. This sensor's brand new, though. It's a 20-megapixel imager, bolstered by Olympus' excellent five-axis stabilization system. It also does the same cool things as Olympus' recent OMD series cameras. There's the ""Hi Res"" mode found in the OMD E-M5 Mark II , a tripod-optimized feature that moves the sensor around to capture a 50-megapixel shot. There's also the focus-bracketing feature found in the E-M5 II, E-M10, and E-M1. The PEN series usually bears lesser specs than Olympus' higher-end OMD lineup, but not this one. The PEN-F is basically an OMD-level camera in a throwback body. It captures continuous shots at a rate of up to 20fps, has a lightning-fast autofocus system, boasts shutter speeds up to 1/16,000 of a second, and shoots RAW. Video capture tops out 1080p at 60fps, although you're able to record time-lapse video in 4K at 5fps. For sure, the most compelling thing about this camera is its body. There's a distinct dial on the front that lets you toggle between monochrome, color, and filter effects. Up top, machined aluminum dials handle mode selections, shutter, and exposure compensation, while a heavy-duty scroll wheel on the back lets you dial everything in. This is also the first PEN camera with an eye-level viewfinder; the others only have a live-view LCD screen. And it's no half-assed EVF, as its OLED display has 2.36 million dots of resolution. But there's still a 3-inch flip-and swivel touchscreen on board, and like most cameras these days, Wi-Fi connectivity is built in. Those OMD-level specs in a PEN body come with a price to match, and you'll have to wait about a month to start shooting with it. The PEN-F will be available in early March, priced at $1,200 for the body only. It's compatible with Micro Four-Thirds system lenses-which have a bigger-than-most crop factor of 2x. Your phone is disgusting. I'm sorry, but it's true. It's covered in germs and... well, and worse . It also stays dirty, because you never clean it, because doing so would ruin it. Tricky situation! Tricky and gross. It's something that the Kyocera Digno Rafre looks to remedy. The Digno Rafre, available in Japan, has pretty basic specs for a smartphone; it starts at 16GB storage, has 2GB RAM, a 13MP rear and 2MP front-facing camera. It runs Android 5.1. None of that's enough to turn heads. For neat freaks, though, or those nonplussed by the thought of carrying around millions of bacteria in their pocket every day, it has one crucial advantage: you can wash it with soap. That's more impressive than it may sound. It's hard enough to find a waterproof smartphone today, and until now impossible to find one that can survive the rigors of a rigorous good scrubbing. In fact, even the Digno Rafre has its limits; Kyocera encourages the use of foam-based soap, rather than potentially injurious bars. Kyocera reportedly managed the feat by finding a better way to seal the device. The Digno Rafre's display also works when wet, meaning it may be the first handset targeted specifically at the bubble bath set. The phone's only available in Japan (for $467), and Kyocera has indicated they don't plan to sell it elsewhere. Until they change their minds-or someone else offers a washproof smartphone stateside-you can always opt for constantly wearing gloves, or obsessively washing your hands. Starting today, you can preorder the consumer version of the Gear VR headset for $99. Sure, Samsung's headset has been around for awhile, at least for developers and lucky beta testers who got their hands on the Innovator Edition. But this is the first time the Oculus Rift-powered headset has been sold to regular consumers. The devices will ship November 20. This isn't just some new packaging slapped on the earlier model: According to Oculus , the official Gear VR headset is 19 percent lighter and ""features improved ergonomics,"" like a new touchpad that should make it easier to use. The best news: Gear VR is going to work with more Samsung phones, and there are lots of new games to use it with. If you have a Galaxy S6 Edge, S6, Note 5, or S6 Edge+, you're in the clear (though the last two will require a carrier software update). And perhaps the most exciting new title on the horizon is , a visually stunning game set in an ancient civilization from the makers of Monument Valley . The Gear is just one of a few compelling VR headsets, but it's managed to situate itself nicely for user adoption by aggressively partnering with various media outlets to experiment with consumer VR experiences. Already we've watched NBA games and political debates. Oh yeah, and it's just under 100 bucks. You can order the Gear headset now on Amazon , Best Buy , or from Samsung . We've all done the ""pocket pat down"" to check we have our phones and wallets before leaving the house. But even if you remember to bring your phone with you, it'll be dead weight if you forget to charge it. Sure, you could always bring a spare charger in your bag, but if you like to go out with only the clothes on your back you know that pocket space is a limited resource. Nomad 's new Wallet for iPhone might be able to help all the bagless chumps out. As its name suggests, the Wallet is a battery pack for your iPhone-but it's no bulky charger: It's no thicker than a standard billfold wallet. It measures in at 95mm (height) x 125mm (width) x 25mm (max thickness), so feel free to stuff it with your disposable income and those fro-yo stamp cards. Nomad was able to keep these dimensions by placing the skinny, yet high powered, 2400 mAh battery along the spine of the Wallet. That's enough juice to fully charge an iPhone 6s. When the Wallet's battery is depleted, it can be recharged by any microUSB charger. Flashing indicator lights will tell you how much energy is stored in the Wallet, and when you are ready to connect it to your iPhone, you can un-sheath its built in Lightning cable. Considering that it can hold all these electronics, your cash, and your cards without looking like a lunchbox, that's some serious space optimization. The Wallet for iPhone can be pre-ordered now for $80 ($20 off retail), and is expected to ship November 15. Love the gaming style of arcades but the physicality of, you know, actually moving? This hack turns indoor rock climbing into a real life video game of sorts-and the creator of the code is working with various rock climbing gyms to bring it to their facilities. Maybe it will hit your local rock wall soon. I've watched the teaser video for the RoBoHoN a few times now, and I still don't know what to make of it. Sharp, who made it, calls it ""a phone in human shape, a phone that you feel like talking to."" The name itself is a wonky portmanteau of robot and phone. It can be held up next to your ear just like any other phone. Unlike any other phone, though, it is also a talking robot helper projector music toy assistant man. Sure! In the three-minute video, the RoBoHoN plays all sorts of roles. It waves happily at you when your alarm goes off, sits on your car dash, remembers to buy you more toothpaste in a squeaky anime voice, and then bends over at the waist to point its built-in projector at a table to show you photos from your boyfriend while he tells you how much he loves you while you cry, apparently? You can dress RoBoHoN up in a bunch of different accessories, including Swarovski crystals. He's mostly designed to be talked to, but he has a touchscreen on his back in case you need to touch him. On one hand, this is definitely the worst phone ever. You wear it by a lanyard around your neck, the screen is small and bad, and I mean, come on, the thing is huge and unwieldy and you look like you're holding a toy to your face. But the robot? The robot seems pretty great. RoBoHoN uses facial recognition to tell individual people to smile for the camera. He (I think it's a he? I've been saying ""he"" but it's entirely possible that RoBoHoN exists outside of gender) will help you remember to do stuff; he'll help your kid learn to walk; he'll play music and literally lead the dance party. He can sit, walk, hail cabs, and do a thousand other crazy things. The concept video looks like an out-there student film, or a live-action cut of something Pixar might be working on. But Sharp swears RoBoHoN is a real thing, set for launch next year. In the inevitable army of the robot takeover, this is the one that eats your smartphone. And dammit if it's not just the cutest little everything machine. There's absolutely no reason that your every day computer shouldn't look like an F-22 cockpit simulation. That seems to be the logic behind HP's new 34-inch Curved All-in-One, an impossibly long display that can comfortably accommodate more tabs than is healthy. The shape's not new to HP; the company already sells a 34-inch display that looks basically identical. The resolution isn't as eye-popping as, say, a 5K iMac, but a 5K iMac doesn't curve, or cover nearly three feet of ground, diagonally. Now, though, HP has stuffed a computer inside that display, in a glorious act of why not? Inside, you'll find substantial enough guts: The $1,799 base model comes with the latest Core i5 processor and 8GB of memory, and you can upgrade to as much as 2TB of storage, 16GB RAM, and a discrete Nvidia GTX 960A graphics card. All of which is to say it'll do pretty much whatever you might need it to. Most importantly, though, it is gigantic; a multi-monitor set-up that requires just one glorious monitor. It's even, one might venture, innovative, at a time that the PC industry desperately needs innovation . It'll be available Nov. 8, and while it's obviously intended for those with specific needs and muscular budget, the rest of us can at least appreciate a heaping desktop helping of eye candy when we see it. Keurig Kold, a countertop soda-making machine that Keurig hopes will expand its appeal beyond coffee. Keurig, best known for its pod-based, countertop coffee dispensers, is branching out. The new Keurig Kold provides a chilled counterpoint to the company's previous models, serving up sodas from name-brand pod providers like Coca-Cola and Snapple. If that sounds a bit like SodaStream, that's because it is, although there are a few key differences. The most important of which, for those who've grown weary of carbon dioxide refills, is that Kold uses ""Karbonator beads"" embedded in its pods to generate CO2. That means no canisters, and no confusion over just how many bubbles to add. That also means the Kold should be equally adept at non-carbonated beverages, including teas, sports drinks, and flavored water; in addition to its partners, Keurig will be offering its own brands in those categories. Regardless of fizz, as you'd expect from the name, the drinks also come out, well, cold, thanks to what Keurig describes as an ""aerospace-inspired thermal transfer system."" While it's hitting shelves today-or more specifically, hitting Keurig's retail website; it will roll out to stores in select cities later this month-Kold made its debut at an analyst conference this past March, and has been in development the past five years. The long rollout signifies just how important Kold is to Keurig; the company's currently trading at about a third of its 52-week high due to quickly fading sales of its K-Cup-based coffee products, a decline that led the company to announce a 5 percent workforce reduction in August. Kold represents its best chance at a pick-me-up. Then again, Kold's most obvious competition, SodaStream, has been in an extended sales free fall, calling into question whether there's currently a significant market for home carbonation machines in the first place. The device faces other challenges, as well. A coffee pod's prime appeal is ease of use; it's obviously faster and less fussy than parsing out grinds for a traditional drip coffee maker. Making that same case for Kold could be tricky, since it's competing against the simple act of popping the tab on a can, or twisting the top of a bottle. And whatever convenience it does offer doesn't come cheap; Kold comes with an MSRP of $370, with pods costing between $4.50 and $5.00 for a pack of four. Each pod produces a single 8-ounce drink, making your countertop cola more expensive than the grocery store equivalent even before the sunk cost of the machine itself. Push-button drink production has a demonstrable appeal; whether that translates from hot to cold depends on one's counter space, pod appeal, and single-serve obsession. The tablet industry is still going strong, but if we can take away anything from the Microsoft Surface and iPad Pro releases, it's that some people really want keyboards to go with their tablets. Built-in touch screen keyboards simply aren't enough for writing anything longer than a text, and they take up valuable screen space. The thin screen-protector-like keyboards that Microsoft and Apple make are great for portability, but they don't offer the tactile feel that desktop keyboards do. If you want a keyboard that feels awesome (and isn't that portable) what better place to look for inspiration than a good old-fashion typewriter? The folks at Qwerkytoys have created the Qwerkywriter , a tablet keyboard that mimics the look and feel of a typewriter. Even though the Qwerkywriter looks old fashioned, there's plenty of modern tech baked inside. The keyboard pairs with devices via Bluetooth, so even though it has a dock that fits all sorts of tablets, it can be paired with smartphones or even desktop computers. Additionally, that macro return bar isn't just for show: By default, it doubles as an enter key, but can also be programmed to render up to five characters. The Qwerkywriter started as a Kickstarter campaign, but since it already met its goal of $90,000, you can pre-order it now for $329. The pre-orders won't ship out until October or November, but in the meantime you can listen to the satisfying clicks of the Qwerky's keys in action. The maximum load of a PhunkeeDuck-or any other brand of these suddenly popular stand-up scooter boards -is around 300 pounds. The maximum thing you should try to do on one of them is not to fall over. Somehow, personal trainer Bradley Martyn stepped onto one, stuck 315 pounds behind his neck (six 45-pound weights plus a 45-pound bar), and blasted some squats. Four reps, bro. On a spaceboard, bro. This is dangerous, and you should not ever try it. In fact, you can hear the stand-up scooter crack during the initial squat, and again during the fourth rep. Somehow, the contraption held together during the entire feat of strength and balance, and that wasn't the only danger to Martyn's safety. Fall backward, and risk a concussion from the back of your head smacking a solid steel bar. Fall forward, and risk your face being pinned to the floor by 315 pounds. So never attempt this superhuman show of agility, even if you look like He-Man. Still, feel free to watch it repeatedly on the Internet to your heart's desire. Logitech G is launching two new gaming headphones: the G633 and G933 Artemis Spectrum. They are the result of Logitech's sound engineering team's attempt to create a gaming headset that delivers audio comparable to top-shelf headphones. With patent pending Pro-G audio drivers and 7.1 Dolby surround sound, these headphones aim to immerse you into the game. The two headphones look similar, with the G933 as the beefier big brother. The G933 includes a few more features than the G633, such as the ability to operate wirelessly and an additional audio input for sound mixing. But you'll have to pay a little bit more to get these extras, as the G933 costs $200 versus the G633's $150 price tag. Regardless, the two both offer some cool customizable features. By downloading the Logitech Gaming Software, you are able to assign game macro functions to the headset's three programmable G-keys. Additionally, you can use the software to adjust equalizer settings and set up sound profiles that best fit your acoustic preferences. On the other hand, some customizable features are just for fun, like the ability to change the RGB lighting to any color of your choosing. Look out for the Logitech G633 and G933 Artemis Spectrum in October 2015. While your smartphone is an easy conduit for all-emoji conversation, things get a little tough when you find yourself at a regular old laptop. Sure, keyboard shortcuts can get you there, but PC-made discussion is still dominated by... you know, words. Until now! Emoji Key is a set of stickers you can throw on top of your lettered keyboard. Then you just have to install the emoji keyboard on your laptop (the site includes instructions), and boom: You are typing in nothing but emoji. And yes, this would probably get confusing eventually. In Samsung's never-ending quest to take on the iPhone, it's giving customers the chance to test drive one of its Galaxy phones (the S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, or Note 5) for 30 days for the low, low price of $1. If you're an iPhone user who's curious about the competition, now is the time to question your allegiance. You'll get a month's worth of data, and since it's not like you have to hand your iPhone over to Samsung, you've essentially got two phones for a month. For a data hog, that's not a bad deal. Really, this should have become a standard a long time ago. According to Reuters , this surfer shelled out $390 to attach a device to his board that emits ""an electronic force field that overpowers [sharks'] sensing organs."" Sounds like the best $390 he ever spent. There are couple of retailers installing these devices, including SurfSafe and SharkShield -check out this video from the former showing you how its done.",en

As part of this acquisition, Google will make Synergyse Training for Google Apps available for free to all Google Apps customers. The company did not disclose the financial terms of the transaction. According to CrunchBase, Synergyse did not raised any outside funding. According to Synergyse's own data , the service has trained over 4 million people in 3,000 organizations so far. That probably makes it the most popular training service for Google Apps and it probably didn't hurt that the service was built on top of Google's Cloud Platform either, which should make integrating it with Google's own services relatively easy. While figuring out how to use Google Apps for Work may seem trivial to many of us, there is actually a huge demand for this kind of training. Google notes that companies that use this training program see ""on average 35 percent higher adoption across Apps products."" Here is Synergyse's description of the company's incredible journey : ""By joining the Google Apps team, we can accelerate our mission because we will be working even closer with the teams that build Google Apps. Advancing our mission at a faster speed is very exciting for the Synergyse team and our customers will directly see the benefits as we move forward."" Google says it will integrate Synergyse into its own products later this year. Existing customers will be able to continue using the service and new customers can now download the Chrome extension for free.",en

Cost: Free Questions? Please send email to Machine learning is in the midst a renaissance. Technical advancements in machine learning are enabling a broad assortment of new possibilities for designers to better engage with and understand users. Yet, these technologies also bring new challenges and require new ways of thinking about the design of user interfaces and interactions. Using intuitive analogies and tangible examples, Patrick Hebron offers an introduction to contemporary machine-learning systems and explores how these emerging capabilities will transform the next generation of computing interfaces, such as search engines, intelligent assistants, connected homes, and open-world video games. This webcast is intended for user interface and user experience designers as well as anyone interested in how recent advancements in machine learning can radically enhance software capabilities through natural language processing, image recognition, content personalization, and behavior prediction.

A primeira aeronave com o novo design e pintura chega na madrugada de hoje ao Rio de Janeiro e já no dia 1 de maio vai para Genebra buscar a Tocha Olímpica. O Melhores Destinos acompanhou a entrevista coletiva e apresenta todos os detalhes, como a nova pintura que vai substituir a da TAM e a da LAN, bem como os novos uniformes e demais aplicações da nova LATAM! A primeira aeronave com imagem LATAM a entrar em operação, um Boeing 767, decolará do Rio de Janeiro em 1º de maio com destino a Genebra, para buscar a Tocha Olímpica. O avião será preparado especialmente para a ocasião e retornará a Brasília, local onde terá início o tour de Revezamento da Tocha dos Jogos Olímpicos Rio 2106, que passará por mais de 300 cidades do Brasil. No dia 5 de maio, irão decolar os três primeiros voos comerciais das aeronaves com a nova imagem LATAM nas seguintes rotas: São Paulo-Santiago (um Boeing 767 com saída de Guarulhos às 09h05, horário local); Santiago-Lima (um Airbus A319 com saída de Santiago às 09h10, horário local); e São Paulo-Brasília (um Airbus A319 com saída de Guarulhos às 14h20, horário local). ""Nos próximos dias, os passageiros verão as aeronaves das companhias do Grupo LATAM no ar com a nova imagem LATAM, o que será um marco histórico para o maior grupo aéreo da América Latina"", afirmou Enrique Cueto, CEO do Grupo LATAM Airlines. ""Será uma mudança gradual, cujo principal objetivo é simplificar e melhorar a experiência de viagem dos nossos passageiros"". O executivo garantiu que ""a partir das próximas semanas, nossos passageiros poderão ter uma experiência LATAM ao comprar pelo site da LATAM, acumular quilômetros nos programas de fidelidade LATAM, fazer o check-in nos balcões da LATAM, visitar nossas Salas VIP LATAM e, o mais importante, viajar nas aeronaves com a nova imagem LATAM. Continuaremos aprimorando a maior malha de destinos da América Latina, operando com a frota mais moderna da região, e investindo em ferramentas digitais que nos permitam oferecer uma experiência de viagem personalizada"". A LATAM espera finalizar a pintura exterior de mais de 50 aeronaves em 2016, e concluir a alteração de toda a frota até 2018. A pintura das aeronaves leva, em média, de 6 a 12 dias cada, e será realizada durante a manutenção de rotina das aeronaves para obter a maior eficiência possível do processo. Também no dia 5 de maio, terá início a mudança para a imagem LATAM em 13 dos aeroportos onde as companhias do Grupo LATAM operam, nas cidades de Santiago, São Paulo/Guarulhos, São Paulo/Congonhas, Rio de Janeiro/Galeão, Brasília, Buenos Aires/Ezeiza, Lima, Bogotá, Quito, Miami, Madri, Guayaquil e Nova York (JFK). A alteração inclui a sinalização dos balcões de check-in, Salas VIP, cartões de embarque e informações nas telas. Ainda nos primeiros dias de maio, a LATAM lançará seu novo site, www.latam.com , disponível em seis idiomas. Por meio dessas plataforma, os passageiros poderão reservar suas passagens, fazer o check-in, visualizar o Status de Voo em tempo real, receber alertas e acessar informações úteis sobre sua viagem. Além disso, hoje a LATAM apresentou seus novos uniformes, que serão utilizados por 23.000 funcionários, e espera implementar a mudança em nível global até o final de 2016. Os uniformes LATAM - que refletem a essência do Grupo por meio das formas e cores da nova imagem, o Índigo e o Coral - foram desenhados pelo estilista brasileiro mundialmente reconhecido Pedro Lourenço, em cooperação com grupos de trabalho dos quais participaram mais de 80 funcionários de diferentes áreas da empresa. O Grupo LATAM ainda anunciou a implementação de uma nova revista e plataforma de conteúdo, Vamos/LATAM, oferecendo conteúdo com o melhor da América Latina em vários formatos, disponíveis em espanhol, português e inglês. Além disso, durante 2016 será lançada uma nova carta de vinhos latino-americanos para todos os voos internacionais das companhias do Grupo. Isto se soma ao LATAM Entertainment, o sistema de entretenimento de bordo sem fio para aeronaves de curta distância (Airbus A319, A320, A321) que a empresa já implementou em 200 aeronaves em 2015. Nova tecnologia para pintura das aeronaves O Grupo LATAM Airlines adotou uma nova tecnologia de pintura das aeronaves, 25% mais leve que a convencional. Com ela, a empresa deve obter uma redução de 20kg, em média, em todas as aeronaves da companhia que mudarem a imagem. . A pintura de um avião é um processo que requer diversas soluções de engenharia. Para um Boeing 787, por exemplo, são utilizados 300 litros de tinta e 150 litros da nova tecnologia Clearcoat, que é o verniz protetor que dá brilho e protege contra temperaturas extremas e desgaste aerodinâmico. No total, o processo de pintura leva seis dias: dois para retirar a pintura antiga e quatro para realizar a pintura por camadas. O novo sistema Clearcoat utilizado pela LATAM na pintura de suas aeronaves também contribui para o meio ambiente, pois reduz o peso dos aviões. Esta medida resultará em redução das emissões de CO2 na atmosfera em 3.900 toneladas por ano. Mais algumas imagens divulgadas hoje: E ai? Gostaram do visual dos aviões da LATAM?

Spark is now generally available inside CDH 5. One of Apache Spark 's main goals is to make big data applications easier to write. Spark has always had concise APIs in Scala and Python, but its Java API was verbose due to the lack of function expressions. With the addition of lambda expressions in Java 8, we've updated Spark's API to transparently support these expressions, while staying compatible with old versions of Java. This new support will be available in Spark 1.0. A Few Examples The following examples show how Java 8 makes code more concise. In our first example, we search a log file for lines that contain ""error"", using Spark's filter and count operations. The code is simple to write, but passing a Function object to filter is clunky: Java 7 search example: (If you're new to Spark, JavaRDD is a distributed collection of objects, in this case lines of text in a file. We can apply operations to these objects that will automatically be parallelized across a cluster.) With Java 8, we can replace the Function object with an inline function expression, making the code a lot cleaner: Java 8 search example: The gains become even bigger for longer programs. For instance, the program below implements Word Count, by taking a file (read as a collection of lines), splitting each line into multiple words, then counting the words with a reduce function. Java 7 word count: With Java 8, we can write this program in just a few lines: Java 8 word count: We are very excited to offer this functionality, as it opens up the simple, concise programming style that Scala and Python Spark users are familiar with to a much broader set of developers. Availability Java 8 lambda support will be available in Spark 1.0, which will be released in early May. Although using this syntax requires Java 8, Spark 1.0 will still support older versions of Java through the old form of the API . Lambda expressions are simply a shorthand for anonymous inner classes, so the same API can be used in any Java version. Prashant Sharma is a committer on the Spark project.

My new manager at Google asked me to draft my OKRs for him to review. I had no idea what he was talking about. I've now gone through the process of setting my Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) 24 times, and each time I marvel at what an effective mechanism they are for focusing my effort as well as aligning my work with the company's objectives. Last fall, I led a workshop about OKRs at the Startup Lab, which we're making public today. John Doerr originally presented OKRs to Google's leadership in 1999 when Google was less than a year old, and they've been in use ever since. In the video, I present a portion of John's original deck, then lay out how we've implemented them at Google over the years. I also shared a few of my OKRs from my time as a Product Manager on Blogger, and answered some questions from the employees at our portfolio companies who were present for the workshop. Though the video goes into more detail, here are a few keys to what make OKRs work at Google: Objectives are ambitious , and should feel somewhat uncomfortable Key Results are measurable ; they should be easy to grade with a number (at Google we use a 0 - 1.0 scale to grade each key result at the end of a quarter) OKRs are public ; everyone in the company should be able to see what everyone else is working on (and how they did in the past) The ""sweet spot"" for an OKR grade is .6 - .7 ; if someone consistently gets 1.0, their OKRs aren't ambitious enough. Low grades shouldn't be punished ; see them as data to help refine the next quarter's OKRs. One comment: in talking recently with one portfolio company who's implemented OKRs, I realized that I should have been more emphatic in pointing out that OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations . OKRs are about the company's goals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance evaluations - which are entirely about evaluating how an employee performed in a given period - should be independent from their OKRs. We'll cover employee evaluations in an upcoming workshop. About the Startup Lab workshops Since its inception, the Google Ventures Startup Lab has held more than sixty workshops. These sessions are open to every employee of our 160+ portfolio companies and are held on a variety of topics: everything from privacy to Javascript testing to business development. Speakers are drawn from experts at Google and beyond. More than 95% of our portfolio companies have attended at least one workshop, and our recorded talks have been viewed thousands of times. We began releasing public versions of select workshops to share with the broader entrepreneurial community, and will release new videos several times a month.",en

The companies have adopted the approach are growing like weeds. OKRs provide focus, united the teams behind a single strategy, and makes all goals into stretch goals. If want to get your entire company to execute like the hounds of hell are behind them and the gates of Valhalla are open before them, try the OKR approach out. OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results . The form of the OKR has been more or less standardized. The Objective is qualitative, and the KR's (most often three) are quantitative. They are used to focus a group or individual around a bold goal. The objective sets a goal for a set period of time, usually a quarter. The key results tell you if the objective has been met by the end of the time. Before you set OKRs, it is critical your company have a mission. Without a sense of purpose AND a scope to accomplish it, anything you do is equally ok. I've written a bit on this in the North Star post. But once you have a mission you a start attacking it in a methodical way. We do that by setting an objective. Objectives Your objective is a single sentence that is Qualitative and Inspirational The objective is designed to get people jumping out of bed in the morning with excitement. And while CEO's and VC's may jump out of bed in the morning with joy over a 3% gain in conversion, most mere mortals get excited by a sense of meaning and progress. Use the language of your team. If they want to pwn it or kill it, use that wording. Time Bound e.g. doable in a month, a quarter. You want it to be a clear sprint toward a goal. If it takes a year, your objective may be strategy or maybe even a mission. Actionable by the Team I ndependently This is less a problem for start-ups, but bigger companies often struggle because of interdependence. Your Objective has to be truly yours, and you can't have the excuse of ""marketing didn't market it."" For example, some good objectives: Pwn the direct to business coffee retail market in the south bay. Launch an Awesome MVP. Transform Palo Alto's Coupon-Using habits. Close a round that lets us kill it next quarter. and some poor objectives: Sales numbers up 30%. Double users. Raise a series B of 5M. Why are those bad objectives bad? Probably because they are actually key results. Key Results Key results take all that inspirational language and quantifies it. You create them by asking a simple question ""how would we know if we met our objective?"" This causes you define what you mean by ""awesome"" ""kill it"" or ""pwn."" Typically you have three key results. Metrics can be based on That last one can throw people. It seems hard to measure quality. But with tools like NPS*, it can be done. With KRs you can balance forces like growth and performance, or revenue and quality by making sure you have the potentially opposing forces represented. ""Launch an Awesome MVP"" might have KR's of 40% of users come back 2X in one week Recommendation score of 8 15% conversion Notice how hard those are? KRs Should be Difficult, not Impossible One great way to do this is to set a confidence level of five of ten on the OKR. A confidence level of one means ""never gonna happen my friend."" A confidence level of ten is also known as sandbagging. You are looking for a sweet spot where you are pushing yourself and your team to do bigger things, and where you have a 50/50 shot of failing. Take a look at your KRs. if you are getting a funny little feeling in the pit of your stomach saying ""It would take a miracle to hit all three of these..."" then you are probably setting them correctly. If you look at them and think ""we're doomed"" you've set them too hard. If you look them and think, ""I can do that with some hard work"" they are too easy. What Makes OKRs Work? OKRs Cascade The company should set a OKR, and then each team should determine how their OKR leads to the company's successful OKR. They can focus on a single key result or try to support the entire set. For example, engineering might decide satisfication is tightly connected with speed (and they'd be right.) So set an OKR like Performance Upon Launch Equivalent to an Established Company 99.8% uptime <1 second response time Instantaneous perceived load time (measure by survey, 90% users say page loaded ""immediately"") (I'm not an engineer so please do not mock my KR's too hard) As you can imagine, some teams like product management can easily align their OKRs with the company OKRS, while others may have to dig a little deeply to make sure they are supporting the company goal. Much of the value in OKRs comes from the conversations on what matters, how it will be measured and what it means for the teams who are used to working from their own standards, apart from the business goals. Customer service, design and engineering often have to work a little harder to find meaningful OKRs that will move the business goal forward. But it's worth doing. Can customer service upsell disgruntled customers to a better plan? Can design crate an onboarding flow that improves retention? Can engineer increase satisfaction with a better recommendations algorithm? No department can be an island. As well, each individual should set individual OKRs that reflect both personal growth and support the company's goals. If the company's OKRs is around aquistion, a product manager might decide she wants to ""Get great at sales."" She then might chose KRs of completing sales training with a high score as well as improving the conversation rate of the product she runs. Individual OKRs are about becoming better at your job, as well as helping your product get better. It's also a gift to managers struggling with a difficult employee. In the Individual OKR setting process, she can work with that person to set goals that correct those problems before they blossom into full disciplinary actions. By setting measurable KRs, she can avoid accusations of personal bias if things do not improve. OKRs Are Part of Your Regular Rhythm When people fail, it's often because they set OKRs at the beginning of the quarter, and then forget about them until the end of the quarter. In between you are barraged by teammate requests, the CEO sending you articles, customer requests... there are always 101 interesting things to spend your time on that do not lead to success. I highly recommend baking your OKRs into your weekly team meetings (if you have them) and your weekly status emails . Adjust your confidence levels every single week. Have discussions about why they are going up or down. Do Not Change OKRs halfway through your bounded time period. Suck it up and either fail or blow past them, and use that learning to set them better next time. No team gets OKRs perfect the first time. You are aiming to achieve 1-2 of the three KRs for you objective. As well, changing them dilutes focus, and keeping teams focused is the entire point of the OKR. Some companies have two or three OKRS, but I recommend starting (and perhaps staying with) only one company OKR, and one supporting OKRs set per team. Get Ready to Fail... BIG! Let's be honest: we hate to fail. Everyone in the valley gives lip service to failure, but really we still don't like it. But OKRs aren't just about hitting targets but about learning what you are really capable of. They are there to push you to do better. And honestly, if you missed the KR of 15% conversion but got 10%, are you heart broken? It's a great metric, and you've learned a ton about what works and what doesn't. Compare that to the goal you thought you could make, maybe 2% conversion because you'd been reading the 80/20 articles. If you shoot for the moon, you may not make it but it's a hell of a view.

It was leading to dupes (and trips!) of things showing up and just making a general mess. So I thought I would help. I get everything reduced to just a couple of calendars synced to iCloud. Then I go to move her Google Calendar to iCloud like I did with my own GCal. I export her ics file, import it into iCal, and merge it into her normal calendar. Everything looks normal. Until iCloud starts sending out acceptance emails to people for meetings from her work calendar (that had been synched with Google Calendar back in 2008 and 2009). Yep, tens, maybe hundreds of acceptances to meetings that were years old. I'm sure there's a setting that I missed somewhere, but that just doesn't seem like the right thing, Apple, now does it? With the holiday season upon us, I got a few Evites that broke my Greasemonkey script to add Evite invitations to your Google Calendar. I went through and cleaned up the code a bit, and I think it'll work a bit better now. You'll find the ""Add to Google Calendar"" link next to the Print link on most invites. Evite2GoogleCal.user.js v1.2 So, Google announced recently that it would support CalDAV syncing with iCal , which means if you update an entry in iCal (or Google Calendar), they'll be in sync within a few minutes. Awesome. Unfortunately, it meant that my previous script iteration would now continually add alarms, leading to each entry having 3 or 4 alarms. Turns out that updating a local iCal calendar and adding an alarm actually updates that same info at GCal. Which is awesome (but was unexpected). So, I made a small tweak to the script, which makes it run a bit faster and makes sure that you only get one alarm on an entry: Try this instead: tell application ""iCal"" set theCalendars to {""Cal1"", ""Cal2""} repeat with theCurrentValue in theCalendars tell calendar theCurrentValue set theEvents to every event repeat with theCurrentEvent in theEvents tell theCurrentEvent if not (exists sound alarm of theCurrentEvent) then make new sound alarm at end / with properties {trigger interval:-15} end if end tell end repeat end tell end repeat end tell That basically means it won't add another sound alarm if the entry already has one. Much handier. In fact, you could just take that script and have it run every few hours (either cron'd or via iCal), and not have to worry about the iTunes Sync script.",en

Most people download an app, open it once, and delete it. This happens because users try out a lot of apps but decide which ones they want to delete within the first few days. Are these user behaviors a result of poorly made apps? Not always, but the first interaction with the app plays a key role in creating overall impression (either good or bad). And when users open a new app the last thing they want to see is multiple popups in a row asking for permissions: App Would Like to Access Your Locations App Would Like Access Your Contacts App Would Like to Access Your Camera This action has a very negative impact on user experience and usually leads to the appbeing discarded. The app needs to be able to keep in touch with users before asking for permissions, in order to retain engagement. In this article will get you on the right track by helping you avoid common pitfalls in your permission request logic. Build a Strategy When it comes to requesting permission, the worst thing an app can do is to bombard users with permission requests without any notice or explanation. Both asking your users for permission too early or for too many things at ones are common mistakes. And yet, many apps still do that - right up front, as the first thing the user sees when opening the app. For example, Inbox by Gmail asks for permissions even before its onboarding tour, with no additional information or context. When you send permissions requests, you expect all users to accept the request. In order to achieve this goal, your should build a permissions strategy . Permission strategy depends on the clarity and importance of the permission type you are requesting. Critical permissions should be requested up-front, while secondary permissions may be requested in-context. When to Ask The User One of the biggest factors that determines whether users accept or deny your requests is when they occur. A simple rule: Don't ask a user for access until you really need it. Ask Up-front Only For Critical Permissions For many apps, not getting access to data can change the entire user experience. For example, if an app depends on SMS service, declining access to the service makes the app useless. Luckily, users expect a messaging app to request SMS permissions, so requesting it up-front makes sense. When more than one permission is needed for a feature to work, a sk for those permissions only and nothing extra . Takeaway: Make sure that user are clearly understands what the app does (based on app's description or previous familiar experience) and ask up-front only critical permissions which user expect the app to request. Ask For Permissions In-context In most cases, if a new user experience begins with a set of permissions requests, you may be missing a critical opportunity to engage users . Apps should ask for permissions in context and communicate the value the access will provide. Because once users are engaged, they could be more likely to accept your requests. Takeaway: Users are more likely to grant permission if asked during a relevant task. How To Ask The User Apps should clarify why each permission request is needed, either through the feature name or an explanation provided. Remember, if you want to get a Yes answer, you have to ask nicely . A simple rule: Make sure it's crystal clear for users what they'll get in return for accepting the request. Benefit Explanation Permissions that are less clear should provide education about what the permission involves. If your app has a walkthrough, use it to explain what your app does and why unexpected permissions will be requested. Explaining a permission in context is another well-done example - it helps gauge user interest and improve comprehension of the permission. Try to explain to a user the benefits they'll receive by giving the app access. Priming During The Request You can do this by providing a background image that explains the permission request. Foursquare primes users by providing a background image that explains why the app needs that particular permission. ""Primer"" Message Before Actual Permission Request You can only trigger iOS default permission request once per feature. The worst possible thing is for a user to deny permission at the system level, because reversing that decision in iOS is very complicated. In most cases, it's better to ""prime"" your users to accept requests before the actual iOS permission request screen appears. Cluster is a good example of priming before the request. Cluster's flow includes a context-building screen, a primer , and then finally the permission request. Using pre-permissions dialogs made the ""Don't Allow"" problem for Cluster almost disappear. Ask In Context of Action User-triggered dialog works even better that context-building screen, because users are expecting the request and more likely to allow a permission when they want to use the feature it enables. Wait until a feature is invoked to request permission. When the user taps a feature like the camera in Cluster app, that triggers the request for photo permissions. How To Deal With Denied Permissions Because denying permissions may prevent a feature from working as intended, whenever a permission is denied it should be explained to the user. A simple rule: You should provide feedback whenever a permission is denied. Critical Permissions If the app can no longer run because a critical permission has been denied, explain why that permission must be allowed and offer a link to open Settings so the user can allow it. Below is an example of Google Hangouts screen that explains that a permission is needed for an app to function. Conclusion Clearly every app is different, but you should thinking about when the user would need access to different parts of their phone and data, and making sure they expect to be asked. Improving the user experience is an ongoing experience. Don't miss the opportunity to prepare your user to accept permissions! Test the each case to see what works best for you. Thank you!",en

(Yes, it's still around. Time, Inc. acquired it and other properties when it bought Viant earlier this year.) But user data never really dies, unfortunately. For Myspace's new owner, that's bad news, as the company confirmed just ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend in the U.S., that it has been alerted to a large set of stolen Myspace username and password combinations being made available for sale in an online hacker forum. The data is several years old, however. It appears to be limited to a portion of the overall user base from the old Myspace platform prior to June 11, 2013, at which point the site was relaunched with added security. Time, Inc. didn't confirm how many user accounts were included in this data set, but a report from LeakedSource.com says that there are over 360 million accounts involved. Each record contains an email address, a password, and in some cases, a second password. As some accounts have multiple passwords, that means there are over 427 million total passwords available for sale. Despite the fact that this data breach dates back several years, the size of the data set in question makes it notable. Security researchers at Sophos say that this could be the largest data breach of all time, easily topping the whopping 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords that recently surfaced online from a 2012 hack. That estimation seems to hold up - while there are a number of other large-scale data breaches, even some of the biggest were not of this size. The U.S. voter database breach included 191 million records, Athem's was 80 million, eBay was 145 million, Target was 70 million, Experian 200 million, Heartland 130 million, and so on. The issue with these older data breaches is that they're from an era where security measures were not as strong as today. That means these passwords are easily cracked. LeakedSource notes that the top 50 passwords from those cracked account for over 6 million passwords - or 1.5 percent of the total, to give you a sense of scale. The passwords were stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, as LinkedIn's were, too. That allowed Time, Inc. to date the data breach to some extent, as the site was relaunched in June 2013 with strengthened account security, including double-salted hashes to store passwords. It also confirmed that the breach has no effect on any of its other systems, subscriber information, or other media properties, nor did the leaked data include any financial information. Myspace is notifying users and has already invalidated the passwords of known affected accounts. The company is also using automated tools to attempt to identify and block any suspicious activity that might occur on Myspace accounts, it says. ""We take the security and privacy of customer data and information extremely seriously-especially in an age when malicious hackers are increasingly sophisticated and breaches across all industries have become all too common,"" said Myspace's CFO Jeff Bairstow, in a statement. ""Our information security and privacy teams are doing everything we can to support the Myspace team."" However, while the hack itself and the resulting data set may be old, there could still be repercussions. Because so many online users simply reuse their same passwords on multiple sites, a hacker who is able to associate a given username or email with a password could crack users' current accounts on other sites. Of course, it's not likely users even remember what password they used on Myspace years ago, which makes protecting your current accounts more difficult. A better option is to always use more complicated passwords, reset them periodically, and take advantage of password management tools like Dashlane or LastPass to help you keep track of your logins. Myspace also confirmed that the hack is being attributed to the Russian cyberhacker who goes by the name ""Peace."" This is the same person responsible for the LinkedIn and Tumblr attacks, too. In Tumblr's case, some 65 million plus accounts were affected. But these passwords were ""salted,"" meaning they are harder to crack. Myspace is working with law enforcement as this case is still under investigation, the company says.",en

Pelo terceiro ano consecutivo o setor amargou uma queda no número de emplacamentos, despencando de mais de 3,8 milhões de unidades em 2012 para 2,56 milhões em 2015. Mas um segmento, ainda que responda por menos de 3% das vendas, se destaca por apresentar gráficos com uma tendência totalmente oposta. As marcas de luxo, cujo portfólio possui produtos com preços acima dos 100 mil reais, em 2012 emplacaram 48 146 unidades, número que, no fechamento de 2015, saltou para 67 927. De acordo com Milad Kalume Neto, gerente de desenvolvimento de negócios da Jato Dynamics, consultoria especializada no mercado automotivo, trata-se de uma volta por cima desse segmento, que foi bastante afetado quando houve a mudança nas regras do IPI. ""O mercado premium vinha em ascendente crescimento quando no final de 2011 o governo alterou as alíquotas de IPI para veículos importados de fora do Mercosul"", explica, citando que, de 2010 para 2011, esse segmento tinha registrado um aumento de 31,1 mil para 47,1 unidades. ""De início, foi necessário uma adaptação, passando, por exemplo, a oferecer um leque de opções mais enxuto, diminuindo sensivelmente a disponibilidade de versões por modelo"". As vendas do segmento Premium caíram bastante em 2012 e as principais marcas no País se viram praticamente obrigadas a aderir aos termos do Inovar Auto. Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz e Jaguar Land Rover decidiram então pela instalação de fábricas aqui no País para, assim, conseguir ampliar o volume de suas cotas de importação - o excedente é sobretaxado em 30%. Desde então, os números nas vendas só cresceram. Crise x resultados Diante do compasso de redução do ritmo do setor automobilístico como um todo em meio à crise político-econômica, a boa performance desse segmento pode ser explicada por uma conjunção de fatores. A primeira, fazendo uma avaliação mais ampla é o crescimento da Classe A brasileira. No entanto, Kalume Neto, isso não quer dizer que o segmento é imune à crise. ""Note que o segmento cresce em participação de mercado, como tendência efetiva observada nos últimos anos, mas cresce menos em vendas absolutas, fruto da crise atual que derrubou o mercado."" Outra questão abordada pelo executivo da Jato Dynamics é relacionado à oferta de produtos no mercado. ""Algumas marcas premium passaram a disputar uma faixa de mercado que tinha, até então, poucos competidores no Brasil, o segmento Upper Medium"", analisa Kalume Neto. Por exemplo, o tradicional consumidor de modelos como VW Jetta, Honda Civic ou Toyota Corolla em suas versões mais caras passou a ter opções de marcas como Audi, BMW e Mercedes-Benz. A atual líder desse segmento, a Audi - que saltou de 14,24% do mercado em 2012 (com 4 960 emplacamentos) para 25,82% em 2015 (17 541) - tem como seus modelos mais vendidos exatamente os mais acessíveis: as linhas A3 (custa a partir de R$ 106 mil) e o Q3 (SUV que parte de R$ 136 mil), exatamente os dois que estão sendo produzidos na fábrica brasileira, localizada em São José dos Pinhais (PR). ""A liderança é uma conquista significativa, sem dúvida, mas é importante ressaltar que nosso trabalho é voltado para garantir a sustentabilidade do negócio a longo prazo"", diz Jörg Hofmann, presidente e CEO da Audi do Brasil. ""Os nossos resultados são reflexo de uma estratégia que criamos ainda em 2013. Nos últimos dois anos, investimos R$ 500 milhões em nossa linha de produção, R$ 200 milhões na expansão de nossa rede de concessionárias e R$ 12 milhões em pós-vendas."" Outro fator importante é apontado por Ivair Berntz, sócio-líder para o setor automotivo da consultoria Delloite no Brasil. ""Esse público que adquire carros acima da faixa dos 100 mil reais tem mais estabilidade e é muito menos dependente da oferta de crédito. E, nesses últimos anos, está tendo condições de realizar antigos sonhos de consumo"". Avaliação parecida faz o diretor de vendas da BMW do Brasil, Martin Fritsches. ""O segmento premium possui uma dinâmica que ainda é um pouco diferente do mercado regular de automóveis. Há um mercado potencial para veículos premium muito relevante no Brasil, cuja expansão se iniciou muito recentemente, o que gera oportunidades."" Fonte: Jato Dynamics Na fábrica de Araquari (SC), a BMW produz os modelos Série 3 (sedã que é, disparado, o seu modelo mais vendido, com 7418 unidades), Série 1, X1, X3 e MINI Countryman. E, recentemente, anunciou que 10 mil unidades do seu SUV de entrada, o X1, serão exportados. ""Nos últimos meses, identificamos uma demanda importante por esse modelo nos Estados Unidos, cujo volume poderia ser atendido pela fábrica de Araquari, por isso estruturamos o projeto recém-anunciado de exportação"", explicou o executivo, destacando a importância da estratégia da flexibilidade de produção implementada globalmente. ""Isso significa que é plenamente viável incluir novos modelos na nossa linha em Araquari,"" Longo prazo Mas a atual indefinição político-econômica faz com que mesmo esse segmento, que obteve resultados bastante positivos em 2015, também sinta seus efeitos. Benrntz, da Delloite, diz que o sinal de alerta já está aceso mesmo nesse mercado. ""A crise já está chegou também na classe média-alta brasileira"". Holger Marquardt, diretor geral de Automóveis da Mercedes-Benz para a América Latina e Caribe, faz avaliação na mesma linha. ""O cenário político-econômico desafiador do Brasil também está afetando o desenvolvimento do mercado de automóveis premium nesse momento"", diz. ""A retomada da estabilidade econômica é essencial para que possamos nos manter em um patamar saudável de crescimento."" A Mercedes disputou a liderança do mercado, em 2015, palmo a palmo com a Audi, fechando o ano na segunda colocação com 17 514 unidades vendidas - apenas 27 carros emplacados a menos. A fábrica de automóveis da Mercedes, localizada no interior paulista, na cidade de Iracemápolis, já produz o modelo mais vendido da marca, o sedã Classe C (7809 unidades em 2015). No segundo semestre de 2016 está previsto o início da produção do SUV compacto GLA. Ainda para Marquardt, a expectativa é de que o patamar de vendas de 2015 do segmento premium seja mantido este ano. ""Mas o Brasil continua sendo um mercado muito estratégico para o Grupo Daimler e nossa expectativa é de que se recupere em longo prazo e volte a atingir novos recordes de venda"", pondera. ""No entanto, isso tudo está relacionado também às variações econômicas e do câmbio"". A questão cambial também é considerada essencial por Hofmann, da Audi, uma vez que praticamente inviabiliza a empresa de operar no azul. ""Enquanto o câmbio não voltar ao patamar de um ano atrás, não será possível ter uma operação rentável"", afirma. Berntz, da Delloite, alerta que muitos modelos que estão sendo renovados já chegaram sofrendo reajustes - como o caso da nova geração do Audi A4, cuja versão de entrada custa R$ 160 mil, 10 mil acima da geração anterior. ""Muitas marcas conseguiram segurar os preços em função de estoques. Para modelos novos, fica difícil segurar."" Otimismo Apesar do volume de vendas um pouco mais modesto que o trio alemão, com 8 815 carros vendidos em 2015, o grupo Jaguar Land Rover foi outro a abraçar o Inovar-Auto. Sua fábrica, que será a primeira unidade 100% Jaguar Land Rover fora do Reino Unido, está localizada em Itatiaia (RJ) e a produção dos SUVs Range Rover Evoque e Discovery Sport terá início ainda este ano. ""Hoje no Brasil o percentual de representatividade das marcas de luxo está em torno de 2 a 3% do total de veículos vendidos no país, sendo que em mercados mais maduros, o segmento de automóveis premium pode representar até 10% do mercado total"", analisa Ruben Barbosa, diretor de vendas da Jaguar Land Rover para a América Latina e Caribe. ""As estatísticas indicam que a indústria automotiva total brasileira pode alcançar, até 2025, cerca de cinco milhões de veículos. O segmento premium também deve acompanhar este crescimento. Os próximos 12 a 18 meses serão desafiadores, mas acreditamos no potencial do mercado no médio - longo prazo"". O crescimento do mercado de carros de luxo acabou atraindo até mesmo quem não se dispôs a construir uma fábrica para poder ampliar as cotas de importação, como é o caso da Porsche. A marca, que até o ano passado vendia seus modelos esportivos de luxo através de um importador oficial, estabeleceu uma operação oficial. ""A decisão de abrir uma subsidiária no Brasil foi feita alguns anos atrás, quando o País estava em uma situação muito mais estável. Mas não há nenhum tipo de arrependimento da nossa parte"", garante Matthias Brück, Diretor Presidente da Porsche Brasil. ""Nós, incluindo a matriz, acreditamos que o mercado brasileiro, especialmente a médio e longo prazo, ainda terá muito potencial de crescimento para nossa marca assim que o cenário político-econômico se acalmar."" Kalume Neto, da Jato Dynamics, corrobora as avaliações dos executivos da Jaguar Land Rover e da Porsche. ""São muitos os fatores envolvidos, mas nós da Jato destacamos que potencialmente haverá crescimento"", diz. ""Ao ponderarmos que 3 grandes fábricas venderão veículos para atender num primeiro momento o mercado brasileiro e depois a América do Sul, esperamos, de forma otimista, um crescimento mínimo de 2% nos próximos 4 ou 5 anos quando serão atingidos entre 4 e 4,5% do total das vendas de veículos no Brasil."" Sinal amarelo Apesar do otimismo a médio e longo prazo, o alerta já está ligado no setor há algum tempo. Mesmo dentre as marcas Premium, a Porsche e a Jaguar foram as únicas que, de acordo com os dados divulgados pela Anfavea (Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores) e Abeifa (Associação Brasileira das Empresas Importadoras de Veículos Automotores) no início de maio, conseguiram crescer no primeiro quadrimestre de 2016 em relação ao mesmo período de 2015. A marca inglesa, do mesmo grupo da Land Rover, subiu de 130 para 223 unidades, um crescimento de 71,5% - fruto do grande sucesso do sedã XE, que representa cerca de 80% das vendas. Já a Porsche foi de 208 para 236 emplacamentos, aumento de 13,5% - tendo como o seu campeão de vendas o SUV Macan. As duas marcas, no entanto, já superaram as suas cotas de importação, o que, evidentemente, reduz a rentabilidade do sucesso nas vendas. Berntz, da Delloite, tem reservas quanto ao programa Inovar Auto. ""Evidentemente é interessante trazer marcas que não estavam instaladas aqui no Brasil, mas todas que vieram tem um baixo volume de produção, entre 10 e 20 mil unidades. Não há ganhos de escala, nem impacto no setor de autopeças"", afirma. ""Além disso, o incentivo econômico é que motivou a sua vinda. Falta incentivo técnico, como por exemplo a padronização técnica no Mercosul para determinados sistemas e um programa de reciclagem de carros antigos.""",pt

Both are the default mapping apps on their respective operating systems ( Android and iOS ). And both are in a race to become the world's first Universal Map  - that is, the first map used by a majority of the global population. In many ways, this makes Google Maps & Apple Maps two of the most important maps ever made. Who will get there first ? And will design be a factor? In this series of essays, we'll compare and contrast the cartographic designs of Google Maps and Apple Maps. We'll take a look at what's on each map and how each map is styled, and we'll also try to uncover the biggest differences between the two. ⚠️ This is an in-depth review, inspired by the styles of Anandtech and John Siracusa . TL;DR : Though they look similar, Google Maps and Apple Maps are different in surprising ways. ( To skip to the Part 1 Summary , click here . ) * * * Four years ago, Google announced that Google Maps had reached one billion unique monthly users . Today, that number is even larger. (Whatever number of Google Maps's users were lost when Apple Maps was released in 2012-Google Maps was back at one billion users by 2014.) One billion is an astounding number-it's one out of every seven people on Earth: It's also far larger than the United States: One billion is so large that even 1% of one billion is huge . It's larger than America's largest city: Put another way, just 1% of Google Maps's user base is larger than all of this : For all of the hype and press surrounding them, notice what's not in the Top 10: Uber , Lyft , AirBnB , Snapchat , WhatsApp , Pinterest , Spotify , Pandora , Netflix , Yelp , Foursquare , Twitter , Periscope , and Amazon- among others. Isn't it interesting that none of these apps made the Top 10 while Apple Maps did ? But then again, Google Maps and Apple Maps aren't just apps- they're also platforms . And as platforms, they're actually inside of many of these other apps. You can't use Uber, for instance, without also using Google Maps, and the same goes for many other apps: * * * So both Google Maps and Apple Maps have really large user bases, and they're not only two of the world's most used apps-they're also inside of many other widely-used apps. Yet given how important they've become, we know relatively little about them. (One of them might become our Universal Map , after all!) It's interesting: I can easily find hundreds of articles that'll tell me the differences between an Apple iPad and a Microsoft Surface, or even the differences between iOS and Android. But I can't find anything comparing Google Maps and Apple Maps, despite how important they've become. And that's a shame, because there are so many questions. For instance: Which map has more labels-Google Maps or Apple Maps? And which map shows more POIs (Points of Interest)? And is one map better than the other at something in particular? We know the exact color gamut of the Apple iPad-but surprising little about our future Universal Map. Well... That ends today. The columns above look very similar - but would you believe that the maps are actually very different? To even what's labeled on the maps themselves: As you can see, the maps are more different than they appear at first glance . And each map shows a surprisingly different view of the world. We'll be examining these differences, and many others, as we continue on. * * * At its heart, this series of essays is a comparison of the current state of Google's and Apple's cartography. But it's also something more: an exploration into all of the tradeoffs that go into designing and making maps such as these. These tradeoffs are the joy of modern cartography - the thousands of tiny, seemingly isolated decisions that coalesce into a larger, greater whole. Our purpose here is not to crown a winner, but to observe the paths taken - and not taken. We'll look at 54 pairs of maps of three different cities: New York, San Francisco, and London. Each pair shows an identical area, pixel for pixel, on Google Maps and Apple Maps - at the exact same zoom: Speaking of New York , we'll center all of the New York map pairs on the Empire State Building: * * * For San Francisco , we'll center the map pairs on Patricia's Green, a park in the center of the Hayes Valley neighborhood: * * * And for London , we'll center the map pairs on Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square: Why are we looking at New York, San Francisco, and London-and not some other cities or areas? First, we want to look at areas where the maps are most likely to be ""finished"" (i.e., areas where the maps are most likely to be complete and up-to-date.) San Francisco is Google's and Apple's backyard, so the maps should be really good there. And New York and London are two of the world's largest, most important cities-so they should've also gotten a lot of attention. We also want to look at very dense cities, cities where there'd be an enormous number of candidates for things to label . New York and San Francisco are the U.S.'s two densest major cities. And London is the E.U.'s largest city. Because of this ""density"" requirement, rural areas won't work for our purposes . In a typical rural area, the things that are labeled are the area's things-and Google and Apple are likely to label the same things. For this study, we want to see what Google and Apple label when they have thousands of things to choose from . We'll choose the Empire State Building, Patricia's Green, and Nelson's Column because they are all close to the centers of their respective cities , and they're all likely to have a variety of different things around them. Finally (and not coincidentally), San Francisco, New York, and London were the three cities where my recent essay, What Happened to Google Maps? , received the most views. (Thank you to everyone who enjoyed and shared that essay! ��) A couple of other notes before we begin: We're only looking at the maps themselves. (Search results, Turn-by-Turn navigation, Street View, Aerial / Satellite imagery, and Traffic displays are all out-of-scope.) We want to see what a map designed for a billion people looks like, so we're only looking at the default maps. (We'll look at map personalization in a later essay. Google offers it; Apple doesn't.) The map screenshots reflect the default , out-of-the-box experience that someone would have upon using them for the very first time. (The screenshots were taken on fresh installs, with clear browser caches - and no accounts were signed into, nor were any searches performed.) All maps, data, and screenshots reflect Google Maps and Apple Maps as they appeared on Saturday, May 14th, 2016. * * * For Part 1, we'll look at three core parts of the map: Cities , Roads , and Places. But how does Apple Maps compare? Does it show more cities than Google? Or fewer? Let's investigate... First, let's take all of our map pairs and count the number of city labels on them: Interesting. On nearly every zoom with city labels, Apple labels more cities than Google . To get a better sense of the differences, let's plot our counts above into a set of graphs: As the graphs show, there's certainly some big differences: Apple is labeling more cities than Google-and in many cases, significantly more . Let's combine the three cities into a single chart and see if we can see any patterns: Much clearer. And look what it shows: Apple, on average, labels more cities than Google at every zoom. The graph tells us that the biggest difference between Google and Apple is at z8. Let's take a look at that zoom across our three cities: First, New York: What a difference! Apple is showing way more cities than Google. It's not even close. (Here, Apple labels 44 cities, while Google labels just 10 .) I wonder why Google doesn't label more cities here? Let's look at San Francisco next: The pattern continues: Apple labels 48 cities, while Google labels just 13 . Though these are the most extreme examples, our graph showed that Apple, on average, labels more cities than Google at zoom. So to answer our first question, Apple Maps generally labels more cities than Google Maps on the maps we looked at . * * * We also saw in What Happened to Google Maps? that the number of roads shown on Google Maps has actually over time: How does that compare to Apple Maps? And which map-Google Maps or Apple Maps-shows more roads overall? Let's investigate that next... �� INVESTIGATION #2 Which Map Shows More Roads? Did you know that the first twelve zooms on each map only show a fraction of an area's actual roads? For instance, these are the roads that Google shows on its eighth zoom-level: And these are the area's actual roads, compared to the roads that Google shows: In the image on the left, you can clearly see where all of the Bay Area's cities are: there's so many roads in some areas (such as San Francisco), all we see are dark blobs. It looks cool, doesn't it? Now look at the image on the right. Google Maps is showing only a tiny fraction of the roads shown on the left. But that's by design. If Google showed all of the area's roads at this zoom, the map would be a cluttered mess, and it'd be difficult to trace any individual road. So Google instead simplifies the map and shows just a selection of the area's most important roads. Apple actually does the same-notice that it also doesn't show all of the Bay Area's roads at this zoom: So neither Google Maps nor Apple Maps shows all of the area's roads at this zoom: Interesting, isn't it? Which map-Google Maps or Apple Maps-shows more roads at more zooms? Let's tally it up: For almost two-thirds of the zooms, Google and Apple show roughly the same number of roads . But for the remaining zooms, where one map shows more roads than the other, it's almost always Apple that's showing more roads. So now that we've looked at roads, let's look at road labels ... which map shows more? * * * There are actually two kinds of road labels on Google Maps and Apple Maps: shields and text labels: Which map shows more of each? First, let's look at shields . We'll start by counting the number of shields on each zoom: Interesting. Now, Google's totals are higher for every city. Let's plot the counts: Our graphs show that Google almost always has more shields than Apple - especially at earlier zooms. In the first graph, the New York one, there's a huge difference at z8. Isn't that the same zoom we looked at a little earlier? The one where Apple labeled far more cities than Google? Let's take another look: Here, Google has 9 shields, while Apple has just 1 . So maybe that's the answer to our earlier question? ( ""Why doesn't Google label more cities here?"" ) Google is prioritizing over-while Apple is prioritizing over! I'm having déjà vu. Are you? Google, on average, shows significantly more shields at earlier zooms, while Apple shows more shields than Google after z12 (but not nearly as many as Google shows early on). This is quite different than what we saw with the city labels... Now that we've looked at shields, what about text labels for roads? Remember, those are the other kind of road labels on Google Maps and Apple Maps: It looks as if things are a bit closer here than they were for the shields - that is, except in London, where there's a wide difference early on, at z12 . Let's average the cities together: Google Maps, on average, shows more text labels for roads at every zoom . Looking at the graph above, there's still a big difference at z12 -the same zoom we saw that huge difference in London on the smaller graphs. Let's see what's going on there in London: Interesting. There's no shields on Google's map-instead, the route numbers are labeled as text. It actually seems to make the map look nicer. ( Perhaps this has something to do with local cartographic expectations? We'll take a look at that in one of the next essays. ) Labeling the roads with text instead of shields, Google ends up with 37 text labels at this zoom. Meanwhile, Apple has just a single text label entirely within view. That's quite a difference, but our graph showed that the largest difference, on average, was actually at z13 . Let's check out that zoom-but since we just looked at London, let's look at a different city. We'll look at San Francisco instead: Comparing the two maps, it certainly looks as if Google shows more text labels for roads. Let's count them up: Google has 28 text labels for roads, while Apple has just 7 ( 25% of Google's count ). And Google labels more of San Francisco's main streets: Market , Divisadero , Mission , Valencia , Guerrero , Dolores , Folsom , Franklin , Gough , Columbus , and Castro are all labeled on Google's map-but missing on Apple's. These are very different maps! So far, we've counted shields and text labels separately. And Google tended to show more of each. Let's quickly add up the totals for both shields and text labels to see the number of road labels on each map: Google Maps, on average, labels more roads than Apple Maps -in some cases, significantly more- on all but two zooms . This is especially interesting, given that Apple shows more roads than Google. Looking at the graph above, the biggest average difference in road labels between the two maps is at z9 . Let's take a quick look at that zoom across our three cities: We're seeing some really interesting results so far: Apple is labeling more cities . And Apple is also showing more roads . But Google has more road labels . Our z8 maps from earlier capture the pattern better than any map we've seen so far: The Google map has more road labels - 19 more than Apple . And the Apple map has more city labels - 34 more than Google . Two very different views of the same area! I keep thinking of our subway maps from What Happened to Google Maps? : Similar to subway maps, our maps below are simple network maps. The cities are the , and the roads are the . And there's basically nothing else labeled on these maps, other than cities and roads (lines and stations) : But it's strange: Google is good at labeling the lines-but not the stations. And Apple's good at labeling the stations-but not the lines. We're only getting half of the picture on each map. And both maps seem imbalanced, don't they? If only we could take the best of both maps above-Google's road labels and Apple's city labels-and somehow combine them together... Let's try a little experiment with our two z8 maps: We'll take the Google Map, but we'll remove its city labels-and we'll take the Apple Map, and we'll remove its shield: (The maps actually don't look too different with those labels removed.) Now let's combine the two maps together: And let's make it even larger: The information density on the combined map is interesting. Perhaps a bit too busy, but certainly interesting. And at least we're now seeing the whole picture. * * * So far, we've only been looking at Cities and Roads . Let's move on to a different part of the map: Places . Most paper maps never had enough room to show every ""place"" on them. Instead, they labeled a selection of an area's most interesting and important places, calling them "" Points of "" or "" POIs "", for short. But today, with multiple zoom-levels, there's plenty of room to show everything. Small businesses, apartment buildings, and even homes -  no place is too small or too unimportant to be shown on today's maps . It's hard to overstate just how big of a change this has been. Google only started adding labels and icons for businesses to its maps six years ago . But like a contagion, those little place icons have spread and multiplied to every corner of the map - and in doing so, they've quickly become a core, expected feature. The "" POI"" is dead - because today, every place is of interest . Given how important "" Places "" have become, let's find out which map-Google Maps or Apple Maps-labels more of them. First, we'll count up the total number of places on each zoom. Ah, there's our culprit: look at all of those Tube stations that Google is labeling at this zoom. Comparing the two maps, those Tube stations really add up! They help give Google a total of 38 places-versus just 14 for Apple: There really isn't much of a difference here: on average, it's less than five across all zooms. So for now, we'll conclude that Google Maps and Apple Maps label a similar number of places . * * * Now that we've seen that Google and Apple label a number of places, are they labeling the places? Or different places? Let's investigate that next... It's a super interesting question: how often are the pairs of maps labeling the exact same places (e.g., the exact same businesses, the exact same landmarks, the exact same parks, etc.)? For example, take these New York maps at z14: There are just 5 places that are labeled on both maps: Times Square, Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, the Empire State Building, and the Flatiron Building. But Google is actually labeling 24 places in total, while Apple is labeling 16 : That means that out of a combined total of 35 unique places on both maps, the two maps have only 5 places in common . That's really surprising. But is it the same for all zooms? Let's take all of our map pairs and count the number of place labels that both maps have in common: Now, let's take those totals and divide them by the total number of unique places on both maps, and see what kind of percentages we get: Wow. In New York, both maps have only 15% percent of their place labels in common! And in London, it's even lower-at just 13%! So, "" How often were the same places shown on both maps?"" Not often at all. And once again, the maps are very different from each other! * * * So as we just saw, the maps don't seem to label the exact places. But do they generally show the same of places? Let's look at that next... In a dense city like New York, there's so many different kinds of places: hospitals, parks, homes, schools, grocery stores, fire stations, skyscrapers, government buildings, cathedrals, universities-the list goes on and on, and it's seemingly endless. Take the maps below: there are thousands of different places that could've been labeled on either of these maps: But similar to what we saw with all of the Bay Area's roads, it would be impossible to show everything that's actually there and still have a legible map: Instead, the maps show just a tiny selection of everything that's actually there. Remember Faisal's picture of the Empire State Building at the beginning of this essay? That's a picture of the same area shown in the maps above. There's a lot of places there! But how do Google and Apple choose these places? (They had thousands to choose from-how did they end up with these ?) And are there specific kinds of places favored by each map? Let's dig into this more... First, we'll divide all of the places on Google Maps and Apple Maps into eight simple categories: Things to Do & See : Landmarks & attractions, entertainment (theaters, stadiums, and nightclubs), and recreation (parks and other spaces). Eat & Drink : Restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc.-anywhere you can be served prepared food and beverages. Shopping & Services : Banks, hotels, shops, stores, markets, etc. Airports Transit Stations : Train and subway stations, bus and streetcar stops. Universities Hospitals Other : Anything that doesn't fit into the other seven categories: corporate headquarters, apartment buildings, homes, etc. Now that we have our eight categories, let's count how many categories appear on each map. We'll do it like this for each pair: And next, let's plot and average those counts: Interesting. At nearly every zoom, Apple Maps is showing a greater number of categories . Though given what we saw in New York (Apple showed five categories, while Google showed four), perhaps it isn't too surprising? Let's take a closer look at each zoom, and see if we can find some other patterns... While we were counting the number of categories on each zoom, I also recorded the number of places for each category shown: Interesting, isn't it? The two maps are really different. Early on, Apple shows airports , while Google shows transit stations . And then as you continue zooming in, both start showing a greater variety of places-though Apple shows a greater variety overall (just as we saw in our graphs). And this certainly matches the map we just looked at-there are lots of transit stations on Google's map and a greater variety of place categories on Apple's: Let's see if we see the same pattern in San Francisco: Here in San Francisco, we're generally seeing fewer places per zoom than we did in New York, but the results are largely the same: Google is prioritizing transit after the first few zooms, while Apple is prioritizing landmarks. Looking at the bar graphs above, z13 looks like one of the most different zooms between the two-let's take a closer look: Ah, this is that zoom where Apple showed very few text labels for roads. Remember that? But perhaps now we see why: Apple is actually showing a greater number of places here than Google ( 15 for Apple, versus 6 for Google). With so many more places labeled on the map, there's probably less room for road labels-hence, the lower road label count we saw earlier. But let's test this theory. First, we'll merge the two z13 maps together: Now, let's look and see if any of Google's road labels collide with Apple's places. Look at that! Apple's place labels collide with seven of Google's road labels. In other words, those place labels are occupying space on the map where roads could've been labeled. That's why we saw the lower road label count on Apple earlier. It's interesting, isn't it? Google is prioritizing roads , while Apple is prioritizing places . And that's why were seeing such noticable differences in the counts. But even when it comes to places , the maps are prioritizing different things: Above, Google is again prioritizing transit places, while Apple is prioritizing landmark places. And Apple is also showing a couple of hospitals and a famous bakery. What's more important on a map like this? Transit? Or landmarks and hospitals? Each map voted with its pixels, and it's interesting to see. (And here we're also seeing the argument for map personalization :Not everyone uses transit, so there might be places-such as landmarks-that are more important to some people. And when it's life-and-death, hospitals are the most important places in the world. But how often does the average person visit a hospital? Personalized maps are better at surfacing the most appropriate places for each person; but for the default map, still has to be chosen ... and that's what we saw above.) Do the patterns we've seen for New York and San Francisco also hold for London? Let's see: Ah, it's all of those Tube and rail stations we saw earlier. The icons don't have text attached to them, so Google is able to pack lots of them onto the map. (34 in total.) It's a clever way of increasing the map's information density: the icons give just enough information that you know that they're Tube stations-and without text, Google can fit even more of them on the map. That's why Google's count is so high at this zoom. Now that we've looked at each city individually, let's average them together to see the overall pattern: Google Maps prioritizes transit stations for several zooms, while Apple generally labels more landmarks . And as you zoom in, both maps show a increasing variety of categories. Both maps also show a surprising number of restaurants (the yellow parts of the bar graphs). But notice that the restaurants don't start appearing until later zooms. And that's another interesting point, isn't it? The places that each map feels are more important are shown earlier, while the places that each map feels are less important are shown later. It's clear that Google thinks transit is important, while Apple thinks that airports , hospitals , and landmarks are important. Two very different views of the world! Now that we have data on the kinds of places shown at each zoom, let's look at how balanced an average is on both maps: We'll use pie charts: A zoom is generally ""balanced"" if no single category comprises more than 50% of its places. And as you can see from the pie charts above, Google isn't particularly balanced for the first nine zooms it labels places on. And in comparison to Google, Apple generally has a better balance of place labels per zoom, overall. We've looked at the place categories that are shown on each zoom - but what about all zooms, taken together? Which category does each map show the ,across all zooms? In other words, which category is each map's favorite? Let's investigate this one last thing... We'll start by adding up all of the place labels in each city, across all zooms: Ok. Now, let's average all of the place labels across our three cities: More than anything else, Google Maps is labeling transit stations , while Apple is labeling landmarks . And Apple, on average, also shows twice as many restaurants and stores than Google. Interesting, isn't it? The maps are very different! Everything said, the number of transit stations labeled is clearly the largest difference between the two -and Google labels far more than Apple. And that's actually quite intriguing, given that Google also offers a dedicated transit map. But that's an interesting question, isn't it? If there's already a dedicated transit map, why not use the main map as an opportunity to show different, non-transit places? Then again, transit stations are important visual cues for way-finding -  even if you're not actually ""taking"" transit . And when transit stations are labeled with text, they actually double as area labels (e.g., Leicester Square, Charing Cross, Piccadilly Circus), adding even more detail to the map: So there's definitely value in labeling transit stations on the main map. But is that value still there if all of the stations aren't shown? For example, take another look at our San Francisco maps from earlier - the ones where Google prioritized transit and Apple prioritized landmarks and hospitals: If you're familiar with San Francisco, you might notice that even though Google is prioritizing transit, half of the BART stations are actually missing: There's actually a handful of stations missing here too: The missing stations provoke an interesting design question: if you can't label all of a system's stations, should be labeled? In other words, is it deceptive to only label some stations? (Some people using the map-tourists, especially-may not realize that some of the system's stations aren't labeled.) We saw earlier in San Francisco that Google seemed to be prioritizing road labels over place labels: Perhaps this is what's actually causing the missing BART stations? Notice below that road labels cover two of the missing BART stations, while the third missing station is clipped by the label for Downtown San Francisco (i.e., the ""Financial District"" label): There's so many things to label at this zoom (roads, places, districts, etc.), in such limited space-and only a handful of things can fit. Perhaps this is why Apple doesn't even seem to try to label transit stations? (Perhaps it knows that, with everything else that has to be labeled, it can't fit all of the stations?) Similar to Google, Apple also offers a dedicated transit map. And you get the sense that because Apple offers one, it instead uses its default map as an opportunity show different, non-transit places. Is that what's really going on? We don't know-but it's certainly interesting to observe such different approaches! And it goes to show just how difficult cartography really is: seemingly small decisions, such as prioritizing road labels over place labels, can impact the larger map in unexpected ways (such as preventing all of a city's transit stations from appearing together at the same zoom). It's all really fascinating. ▪︎ End of Part 1 We looked at 54 pairs of maps across three cities (New York, San Francisco, and London) and found several significant differences: Apple Maps, on average, labels more cities than Google at every zoom. Google Maps, on average, labels more roads than Apple on nearly every zoom. For two-thirds of zooms, both maps generally show the same number of roads . For the remaining third, Apple almost always shows more roads. Both maps, on average, label a similar number of POIs -but have only 15% of their POIs in common on an average zoom. Both maps also prioritize different kinds of POIs : Google Maps heavily prioritizes transit , while Apple prioritizes landmarks . Apple also generally shows a greater number of POI categories on a given zoom-and shows twice as many restaurants and shops as Google. We've covered a lot of ground, but we're just getting started. Now that we've looked at three important parts of the map (Cities, Roads, and Places), we'll turn our attention to what's on the maps, as a whole. For example, which map has more labels? And which map is more detailed overall? And does one map show things that the other map doesn't? It's only going to get more interesting. I hope you'll join me for Part 2 - coming soon.

Set Up: This assumes that you already have your project set up using Maven, Nexus. You need Nexus or any other repository management system to store artifact of jar or CQ package zip artifact you need to use in your project. Assumption: You are using ""content-package-maven-plugin"" to create CQ package. More information about this artifact can be found here Solution: For jar file it is simply adding it to your embed statement and for zip file you could use subPackages configuration. Once you will run maven install with this configuration, Other project package will also get installed with your package. Same works for uninstall of package as well. Geometrixx all package uses similar approach. your final pom will look like this, NOTE : When you are using other CQ projects as dependency in to your project, make sure that other project is not overriding configurations in your project. You might have to adjust other project package filter accordingly.",en

Today after tests in a few countries, Facebook is rolling out its augmented Like button ""Reactions"" to all users. This article has been boiled down to six emotions too. Like - Facebook designed Reactions so Liking is still as easy ever. You'll still see the Like button on every post. But now if you tap and hold on it, the Like will expand to reveal the other emotions: Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry. Drag your finger across and you can select one. Now instead of a Like count, posts will display the total Reaction count, and show the icons of the most popular Reactions. This way, Facebook doesn't have to clutter the feed with individual counts of each emotion. If you do want to know the breakdown, you can tap the Reaction count and see who felt what. This design is smart because if you don't want to use Reactions, you don't have to, and there aren't six buttons on every post. Love - Reactions were created after Mark Zuckerberg told his team ""I want to really make it easy for people to give other types of feedback than the Like button in News Feed"" according to News Feed engineering manager Tom Alison. Sometimes when a friend shares a post about a tragedy or something that annoys them, it doesn't feel right to Like it, and commenting can be awkward, but you still want to express empathy. For example, is something sad happens to a friend, Liking isn't right, but adding a generic ""sorry"" comment can feel cold. By hitting the animated Sad button, you can express your condolences and solidarity. With any luck, this will encourage people to be more vulnerable on Facebook. Instead of the constant Success Theater where people only share the highlights of their lives, they might be more real with their friends. Wow - By adding Reactions, Facebook will now have a much more accurate perception of what we feel and what kind of posts resonate with each of us. It can use that knowledge to better filter the News Feed to show more things that Wow us. Haha - We comment ""Lol"" on so many Facebook posts, that Facebook thought there could be a simpler way. To design Reactions it looked at the most common one-word comments and stickers used on News Feed posts, grouped them together, and found that these six emotions capture almost every way people feel across cultures. Sad - Facebook seems to have blatantly copied Path's design for the expandable Like button with basic emotions, yet refused to acknowledge the fellow social network as an inspiration when I asked. Angry - There's still no ""Dislike"" button, and that's sure to piss some people off.",en

Números primos só podem ser divididos por um ou por si próprios: é o caso do 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 etc. Eles têm grande utilidade na criação de algoritmos na criptografia de chaves públicas, e por vezes aparecem na natureza - por exemplo, certas cigarras só saem da toca após 7, 13 ou 17 anos . Ainda não sabemos se existe um padrão que explica esta sequência, e não existe nenhuma fórmula para saber quando um número primo vai aparecer nessa sequência; os matemáticos ainda não descobriram uma função para tanto. No entanto, a maioria dos matemáticos concorda que existe algo de aleatório na distribuição dos números primos. Ou, pelo menos, é o que eles pensavam. Recentemente, dois matemáticos decidiram testar esta hipótese de ""aleatoriedade"", e descobriram que ela não está correta. Viés inesperado Segundo a New Scientist , os pesquisadores Kannan Soundararajan e Robert Lemke Oliver, da Universidade de Stanford (EUA), detectaram um viés inesperado na distribuição de primos consecutivos. Os matemáticos fizeram a descoberta ao checar a aleatoriedade nos primeiros cem milhões de números primos. Eles só podem terminar em 1, 3, 7 ou 9 (se tiverem mais de um dígito); matemáticos acreditavam que dois números primos seguidos terminariam com o mesmo dígito 25% das vezes. No entanto, isso não acontece. A chance de um número primo terminado em 1 ser seguido por outro também terminado em 1 é de apenas 18,5%. Números primos consecutivos terminados em 3 e 7 aparecem 30% das vezes; e primos terminados em 9, cerca de 22%. Este não é um padrão perfeitamente aleatório. Os matemáticos foram mais longe e analisaram o primeiro trilhão de números primos. A distribuição se aproxima de algo aleatório, mas o viés persiste. Ele existe até mesmo quando você não usa a numeração em base 10. Ou seja, isso é mesmo algo inerente aos números primos - e é algo imprevisto. ""Sabemos vergonhosamente pouco"" No estudo , Soundararajan e Lemke Oliver tentam encaixar essa descoberta na chamada ""conjectura de k-tuplos"", criada pelos matemáticos G. H. Hardy e John Littlewood no início do século XX - eles deram as bases para as pesquisas modernas sobre números primos. Essa conjectura ainda não foi provada; no entanto, sem ela - e sem a conhecida hipótese de Riemann - a compreensão dos matemáticos sobre números primos fica terrivelmente restrita. ""O que sabemos é vergonhosamente pouco"", diz Lemke Oliver à Nature News . Spencer Greenberg, matemático e fundador do ClearerThinking.org, diz ao Gizmodo que os números primos, assim como os dígitos do pi, parecem muito aleatórios, mas não são. ""Eles são determinados precisamente pelas propriedades dos números. É que, quando nós olhamos para eles, nossos cérebros não conseguem ver o padrão, por isso, eles parecem uma loucura aleatória."" O estudo é fascinante, e como diz o matemático Andrew Granville à New Scientist, ""isso nos dá uma compreensão maior, cada avanço ajuda. Se o que você toma por óbvio está errado, isso obriga a repensar outras coisas que você acha que sabe"". [ Estudo - New Scientist - Nature News ] Foto por Let Ideas Compete /Flickr",pt

The learning process starts with humans creating a bunch of labeled data: images annotated with the objects they depict, pictures of faces with the names of the people, speech recordings with an accurate transcript, etc. Then comes training. A machine learning algorithm processes all that human-labeled data. At the end of training the learning algorithm produces a classifier, essentially a small standalone program that can provide the right answer for new input that was not part of the human-labeled training data. That classifier is what you then deploy into the world to guess your users' age, or recognize their friends' faces, or or transcribe their speech when they talk to their phone. The scarce resource in this equation is the human labor needed to label the training data in the first place. Many impressive Deep Learning results come from domains where enormous amounts of labeled data is available because it was shared by a social network's billion users or crawled from across the web . However, unless you're Facebook or Google, you'll likely find labeled data relevant to your problem somewhat more scarce, especially if you're working in some new vertical that has its own jargon or behavior or data sources. Hence you'll need to get your labels from your users. This entails building some kind of interface that shows them examples of the texts or images or other inputs you want to be able to classify and gets them to submit the correct labels. But, again, human labor - particularly when it's coming from your users - is a scarce resource. So, you'll want to only ask your users to label the data that will improve your system's results the most. Active Learning is the name for the field of machine learning that studies exactly this problem: how to find the samples for which a human label would help the system improve the most. Researchers have found a number of algorithmic approaches to this problem. These include techniques for finding the sample about which the system has the greatest uncertainty, detecting samples for which a label would cause the greatest change to the system's results, selecting samples for which the system expects that its predictions would have the highest error, and others. Burr Settles' excellent survey of Active Learning provides a great introduction to the field. As a concrete example of these ideas, here's a video demonstrating a hand gesture recognition system I built that uses Active Learning principles to request labels from the user when it sees a gesture for which it cannot make a clear prediction (details about this work here ): Don't Treat the User as an ""Oracle"" Active Learning researchers have shown success in producing higher accuracy classifiers with fewer labeled samples. Active Learning is a great way to pull the most learning out of the the labeling work you get your users to do. However, from an interaction design perspective, Active Learning has a major downside: it puts the learning system in charge of the interaction rather than the human user. Active Learning researchers refer to the human who labels the samples they select as an ""oracle"". Well, Interactive Machine Learning researchers have shown that humans don't like being treated as an oracle. In a 2010 paper, Designing Interactions for Robot Active Learners , Cakmak et al studied user perceptions of passive and active approaches to teaching a robot to recognize shapes. One option put the robot in charge. It would use Active Learning to determine the shape it wanted labeled next. Then it would point at the shape and the user would provide the answer. The other option put the users in charge, letting them select which examples to show the robot. When the robot was in charge of the interaction, selecting which sample it wanted labeled in the Active Learning style, users found the robot's stream of questions ""imbalanced and annoying"". Users also reported a worse understanding of the state of the robot's learning making them worse teachers. In a software context, Guillory and Blimes found similar feelings while attempting to apply active learning to Netflix's movie rating interface. Choose Algorithms for Their Ability to Explain Classification Results Imagine you have a persistent health problem that you need diagnosed. You have the choice of two AI systems you can use. System A has a 90% accuracy rate, the best available. It takes in your medical history, all your scans and other data and gives back a diagnosis. You can't ask it any questions or find out how it arrived at that diagnosis. You just get back the latin name for your condition and a wikipedia link. System B has an 85% accuracy rate, substantially less than System A. System B takes all your medical data and also comes back with a diagnosis. But unlike System A it also tells you how it arrived at that diagnosis. Your blood pressure is past a certain threshold, you're above a certain age, you have three of five factors from your family history, etc. Which of these two systems would you choose? There's a cliche from marketing that half of the advertising budget is wasted but no one knows which half. Machine learning researchers have a related cliche: it's easy to create a system that can be right 80% of the time, the hard part of figuring out which 80% is right. Users trust learning systems more when they can understand how they arrive at their decisions. And they are better able to correct and improve these systems when they can see the internals of their operation. So, if we want to build systems that users trust and that we can rapidly improve, we should select algorithms not just for how often they produce the right answer, but for what hooks they provide for explaining their inner workings. Some machine learning algorithms provide more of these types of affordances than others. For example, the neural networks currently pushing the state-of-the-art in accuracy on so many problems provide particularly few hooks for such explanations. They are basically big black boxes that spit out an answer (though some researchers are working on this problem). On the other hand, Random Decision Forests provide incredibly rich affordances for explaining classifications and building interactive controls of learning systems. You can figure out which variables were most important, the system's confidence about each prediction, the proximity between any two samples, etc. You wouldn't select a database or web server or javascript framework simply because of its performance benchmarks. You'd look at the API and see how much it supported the interface you want to provide your users. Similarly, as designers of machine learning systems we should expect to have the ability to access the internal state of our classifiers in order to build richer, more interactive interfaces for our users. Beyond our own design work on these systems, we want to empower our users themselves to improve and control the results they receive. Todd Kulesza , at Microsoft Research, has done extensive work on exactly this problem which he calls Explanatory Debugging . Kulesza's work produces machine learning systems that explain their classification results. These explanations themselves then act as an interface through which users can provide feedback to improve and, importantly, personalize the results. His paper on Why-Oriented End-User Debugging of Naive Bayes Text Classification provides a powerful and concrete example of the idea. Empowering Users to Create Their Own Classifiers In conventional machine learning practice, engineers build classifiers, designers integrate them into interfaces, and then users interact with their results. The problem with this pattern is that it divorces the practice of machine learning from knowledge about the problem domain and the ability to evaluate the system's results. Machine learning engineers or data scientists may understand the available algorithms and the statistical tests used to evaluate their results, but they don't truly understand the input data and they can't see problems in the results that would be obvious to their users. At best this pattern results in an extremely slow iteration cycle. Machine learning engineers return to their users with each iteration of the system, slowly learning about the domain and making incremental improvements. In practice, this cumbersome cycle means that machine learning systems ship with problems that are obvious to end users or are simply too expensive to build for many real problems. To escape this pattern we have to put the power to create classifiers directly in the hands of users. Now, no user wants to ""create a classifier"". So, in order to give them this power we need to design interfaces that let them label samples, select features, and do all the other actions involved in a way that fits with their existing mental models and workflows. When we figure out how to do this the results can be extremely powerful. One of the most impressive experiments I've seen in Interactive Machine Learning is Saleema Amershi 's work on Facebook group invites, ReGroup: Interactive Machine Learning for On-Demand Group Creation in Social Networks . The current Facebook event invite experience goes like this: you create a new event and go to invite friends. Facebook presents you with an alphabetical list of all of your hundreds of friends with a checkbox by each one. You look at this list in despair and then click the box to ""invite all"". And hundreds of your friends get invites to events they'll never be able to attend in a city where they don't live. The ReGroup system Amershi and her team put together improves on this dramatically. It starts you with the same list of names with checkboxes. But then when you check a name it treats that check as a positively labeled sample. And it treats any names you skipped as negatively labeled samples. It uses this data to train a classifier, treating profile data and social connections as the features. It computes a likelihood for each of your friends that you'll check the box next to them and sorts the most likely ones to the top. The features that determine event revelance are relatively strong and simple - where people live, what social connections you have in common, how long ago you friended them etc. - the classifier's results rapidly become useful. This work is an incredibly elegant match between existing user interaction patterns and what's needed to train a classifier. Another great example is CueFlik , a project by Fogarty et al that improves web-based image search by letting users create rules that automatically group photos by their visual qualities. For example (as shown above), a user might search for ""stereo"" and then select just the ""product photos"" (those on a clean white background). CueFlick takes these examples and learns a classifier that can distinguish product photos from natural photos that users can later choose to apply to other searches beyond the initial search for ""stereo"", for example to ""cars"" or ""phones"".",en

O Swatch Bellamy tem aparência de um relógio tradicional, mas conta com tecnologia NFC (de troca de informações em distâncias curtas) em seu interior. Sem uso de senhas, será possível usar o relógio para realizar compras de até 50 reais. Além desse valor, será preciso colocar a senha no terminal. No momento do pagamento, o usuário deve aproximar o relógio ao terminal de pagamentos compatível com a tecnologia. Vale dizer que 2,5 milhões máquinas de cartão são compatíveis com NFC no Brasil. De acordo com a Swatch, o Brasil é o primeiro país das Américas a receber este relógio. Ele já é comercializado na China (com outro parceiro, uma vez que a Visa não opera lá) e na Suíça. A empresa afirma que, por ser bastante discreto, o relógio é uma forma mais segura do que os relógios inteligentes atuais. O relógio funciona de forma parecida com cartões pré-pagos. Antes de usá-lo, portanto, é preciso colocar créditos para que sejam usados nos pagamentos e compras. Ele poderá ser associado a contas de débito da Brasil Pré-Pagos Ele está disponível em branco, azul, preto e uma versão com as cores da bandeira brasileira. O relógio está sendo lançado com foco nas Olimpíadas. Ele será vendido por 725 reais. A Visa, inclusive, tem trabalho bastante em formas de pagamento diferentes com foco nos Jogos Olímpicos. Recentemente, a empresa apresentou uma pulseira que faz trabalho parecido com o do relógio, lançada em parceria com o Bradesco . Outro produto mostrado pela empresa focando as Olimpíadas foi um anel que poderá ser usado para pagamentos e que será distribuído para alguns atletas.",pt

[ Simple Table Commands ] [ What Is Happening? ] [ Really Fancy Table Stuff ] [ Activating Cells For Links ] [ Images in Cells ] [ Framing Images ] You want a table? Okay, here's a table of the Brady family. Feel free to sing. Hey! That's not what I wanted! Yes, it is. You asked for a table. The thing above was made using the <TABLE> and </TABLE> commands. That's a table because... Oh, wait -- I'll bet this is the thing you were looking for: Am I right? You wanted those fancy border lines in the process so it looks like a graph or, dare I say, A TABLE? Simple Table Commands First things first. Let me explain the first table I showed you. The one you didn't want. It will make explaining the bordered table a whole lot easier. Here's the little program I wrote to give me the Brady family table: Now, don't be put off by this little ditty. It looks rough, but look again. There are really only four commands being used again and again. Here's what we use: <TABLE> starts and ends the entire thing. I think that makes perfect sense. This is a table after all. <CAPTION> and </CAPTION> places a caption over your table. The caption will be bolded and centered. Okay, it's a pretty dull caption. Use it if you'd like or feel free to forget it right here. I just thought I'd show it to you. Heck, you're here aren't you? <TR> is used when you want a new T able R ow to begin. Notice that you need to end every table row with an </TR>. See that above? <TD> denotes T able D ata. You put this in front of every piece of information you want in a cell. You need to end every one that you open with an </TD>. See how I have that above? </TABLE> ends the whole deal. It used to be that all of the end TD and end TR commands were not needed. Now they are. With the advent of version 4.0 browsers and HTML 4.0 specs, tables will be rendered incorrectly in Netscape browsers if the end commands are not used. I learned that the hard way when my tables all looked like heck when I upgraded. What Is Happening? What table commands do is create a series of cells. Each cell's data is denoted by the <TD> command. Please note that even though the program above has each cell (or TD) command on a new line, the cells keep going to the right until you tell the computer that a new row of cells will start by using the <TR> or Table Row command. Think of it as constructing a Tic Tac Toe board. You'll need nine cells for the board right? Three across in three rows. Use the <TD> command to make three cells across, use <TR> to jump to the next row, and so on until you have nine cells in three rows of three. Nothing to it. Note that a <TR> is needed first to start the first table row. Note the code above again to see it. Remember that whatever follows the <TD> command will appear in the cell. And the cells, by column, will be of equal size using the largest cell as the model for the others. Biggest wins, in other words... in life, as in HTML. Really Fancy Table Stuff Now on to making the fancy lines between cells. Here, again, is that table above: Okay, so I changed the names, but you get the idea. Below is the program I used to post this deal. Please note that the commands are the same! All I did was add a few things inside of them . If it looks like all the work is done in the <TABLE> command -- it is. You are using three commands to do the work for you: BORDER tells the table how large the border should be. This is all relative in terms of pixels. Three is larger than two and two is larger than one, etc. Try different numbers. I happen to like the look of BORDER=3. BORDER=0 gets rid of the borders altogether. CELLSPACING (all one word) gives the amount of space between cells. I'd keep this kind of small. Large spacing tends to defeat the purpose. CELLPADDING (all one word) gives the amount of space (or padding) between the cell border and the cell contents. Note the cell border walls tend to fill out. A higher number fills out more. Try a few different settings. Sometimes bigger is better. How about that new ""ALIGN"" deal in the <TD> command. See it? I have told the <TD> command I want the data that follows centered within the cell walls outlined in the TABLE command above. Can you do other ALIGN types? Sure. Try ALIGN=""left"" and ALIGN=""right."" Use them in combination in different cells. Set one table cell to left. Set another table cell to center. Save them -- trade them! Activating Cells For Links Wouldn't it be great if you could make a table with words and the words in the table were active so you could click on them? You can! See below: The commands are the same for this table except you place a link command after the <TD> command. Here's what the command for the upper left-hand cell looks like: By the way, the BORDER, CELLSPACING, AND CELLPADDING commands are all set at 20 in the above table to give you an example of some larger numbers. Images In Cells Can I put images in each of the cells? You bet. Here ya go: See?--> All you have done is followed the TD command with an image command. Again, the command that creates the upper left-hand cell is this: Framing Images I am asked at least once a week how to frame an image. What you have done above is basically framed two images. A frame around one image is nothing more than a one-celled table. Here's a framed image: If this is all you want to do, the commands are much simpler than the ones above. You see, there's only the one cell to deal with so there's no need to tell the table any type of CELLPADDING or CELLSPACING unless you want space between the image and the border or you want the border larger. You can if you'd like, but there's really no need. Follow the full use of <TR> and </TR> command. Another quick hint is to keep it all on one line so that the image centers perfectly in the border frame. Here are the commands that placed the above image in a frame: Finally... Just about anything will go inside of a table. The table commands just surround the items with a frame. Try putting a few of your page's items within a frame or a table. It looks professional. Just don't go overboard with it. Then it starts to take on the not-so-nice look of too many lawn ornaments.",en

Some say over 60-70% time is spent in data cleaning, munging and bringing data to a suitable format such that machine learning models can be applied on that data. This post focuses on the second part, i.e., applying machine learning models, including the preprocessing steps. The pipelines discussed in this post come as a result of over a hundred machine learning competitions that I've taken part in. It must be noted that the discussion here is very general but very useful and there can also be very complicated methods which exist and are practised by professionals. We will be using python! Before applying the machine learning models, the data must be converted to a tabular form. This whole process is the most time consuming and difficult process and is depicted in the figure below. The machine learning models are then applied to the tabular data. Tabular data is most common way of representing data in machine learning or data mining. We have a data table, rows with different samples of the data or X and labels, y. The labels can be single column or multi-column, depending on the type of problem. We will denote data by X and labels by y. The labels define the problem and can be of different types, such as: Single column, binary values (classification problem, one sample belongs to one class only and there are only two classes) Single column, real values (regression problem, prediction of only one value) Multiple column, binary values (classification problem, one sample belongs to one class, but there are more than two classes) Multiple column, real values (regression problem, prediction of multiple values) And multilabel (classification problem, one sample can belong to several classes) For any kind of machine learning problem, we must know how we are going to evaluate our results, or what the evaluation metric or objective is. For example in case of a skewed binary classification problem we generally choose area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC or simply AUC). In case of multi-label or multi-class classification problems, we generally choose categorical cross-entropy or multiclass log loss and mean squared error in case of regression problems. I won't go into details of the different evaluation metrics as we can have many different types, depending on the problem. To start with the machine learning libraries, install the basic and most important ones first, for example, numpy and scipy. I don't use Anaconda ( ). It's easy and does everything for you, but I want more freedom. The choice is yours. :) In 2015, I came up with a framework for automatic machine learning which is still under development and will be released soon. For this post, the same framework will be the basis. The framework is shown in the figure below: Figure from: A. Thakur and A. Krohn-Grimberghe, AutoCompete: A Framework for Machine Learning Competitions, AutoML Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning 2015 In the framework shown above, the pink lines represent the most common paths followed. After we have extracted and reduced the data to a tabular format, we can go ahead with building machine learning models. The very first step is identification of the problem. This can be done by looking at the labels. One must know if the problem is a binary classification, a multi-class or multi-label classification or a regression problem. After we have identified the problem, we split the data into two different parts, a training set and a validation set as depicted in the figure below. The splitting of data into training and validation sets ""must"" be done according to labels. In case of any kind of classification problem, use stratified splitting. In python, you can do this using scikit-learn very easily. In case of regression task, a simple K-Fold splitting should suffice. There are, however, some complex methods which tend to keep the distribution of labels same for both training and validation set and this is left as an exercise for the reader. I have chosen the eval_size or the size of the validation set as 10% of the full data in the examples above, but one can choose this value according to the size of the data they have. After the splitting of the data is done, leave this data out and don't touch it. Any operations that are applied on training set must be saved and then applied to the validation set. Validation set, in any case, should not be joined with the training set. Doing so will result in very good evaluation scores and make the user happy but instead he/she will be building a useless model with very high overfitting. Next step is identification of different variables in the data. There are usually three types of variables we deal with. Namely, numerical variables, categorical variables and variables with text inside them. Let's take example of the popular Titanic dataset ( ). Here, survival is the label. We have already separated labels from the training data in the previous step. Then, we have pclass, sex, embarked. These variables have different levels and thus they are categorical variables. Variables like age, sibsp, parch, etc are numerical variables. Name is a variable with text data but I don't think it's a useful variable to predict survival. Separate out the numerical variables first. These variables don't need any kind of processing and thus we can start applying normalization and machine learning models to these variables. There are two ways in which we can handle categorical data: Convert the categorical data to labels Convert the labels to binary variables (one-hot encoding) Please remember to convert categories to numbers first using LabelEncoder before applying OneHotEncoder on it. Since, the Titanic data doesn't have good example of text variables, let's formulate a general rule on handling text variables. We can combine all the text variables into one and then use some algorithms which work on text data and convert it to numbers. The text variables can be joined as follows: We can then use CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer on it: or, The TfidfVectorizer performs better than the counts most of the time and I have seen that the following parameters for TfidfVectorizer work almost all the time. If you are applying these vectorizers only on the training set, make sure to dump it to hard drive so that you can use it later on the validation set. Next, we come to the stacker module. Stacker module is not a model stacker but a feature stacker. The different features after the processing steps described above can be combined using the stacker module. You can horizontally stack all the features before putting them through further processing by using numpy hstack or sparse hstack depending on whether you have dense or sparse features. And can also be achieved by FeatureUnion module in case there are other processing steps such as pca or feature selection (we will visit decomposition and feature selection later in this post). Once, we have stacked the features together, we can start applying machine learning models. At this stage only models you should go for should be ensemble tree based models. These models include: RandomForestClassifier RandomForestRegressor ExtraTreesClassifier ExtraTreesRegressor XGBClassifier XGBRegressor We cannot apply linear models to the above features since they are not normalized. To use linear models, one can use Normalizer or StandardScaler from scikit-learn. These normalization methods work only on dense features and don't give very good results if applied on sparse features. Yes, one can apply StandardScaler on sparse matrices without using the mean (parameter: with_mean=False). If the above steps give a ""good"" model, we can go for optimization of hyperparameters and in case it doesn't we can go for the following steps and improve our model. The next steps include decomposition methods: For the sake of simplicity, we will leave out LDA and QDA transformations. For high dimensional data, generally PCA is used decompose the data. For images start with 10-15 components and increase this number as long as the quality of result improves substantially. For other type of data, we select 50-60 components initially (we tend to avoid PCA as long as we can deal with the numerical data as it is). For text data, after conversion of text to sparse matrix, go for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A variation of SVD called TruncatedSVD can be found in scikit-learn. The number of SVD components that generally work for TF-IDF or counts are between 120-200. Any number above this might improve the performance but not substantially and comes at the cost of computing power. After evaluating further performance of the models, we move to scaling of the datasets, so that we can evaluate linear models too. The normalized or scaled features can then be sent to the machine learning models or feature selection modules. There are multiple ways in which feature selection can be achieved. One of the most common way is greedy feature selection (forward or backward). In greedy feature selection we choose one feature, train a model and evaluate the performance of the model on a fixed evaluation metric. We keep adding and removing features one-by-one and record performance of the model at every step. We then select the features which have the best evaluation score. One implementation of greedy feature selection with AUC as evaluation metric can be found here: . It must be noted that this implementation is not perfect and must be changed/modified according to the requirements. Other faster methods of feature selection include selecting best features from a model. We can either look at coefficients of a logit model or we can train a random forest to select best features and then use them later with other machine learning models. Remember to keep low number of estimators and minimal optimization of hyper parameters so that you don't overfit. The feature selection can also be achieved using Gradient Boosting Machines. It is good if we use xgboost instead of the implementation of GBM in scikit-learn since xgboost is much faster and more scalable. We can also do feature selection of sparse datasets using RandomForestClassifier / RandomForestRegressor and xgboost. Another popular method for feature selection from positive sparse datasets is chi-2 based feature selection and we also have that implemented in scikit-learn. Here, we use chi2 in conjunction with SelectKBest to select 20 features from the data. This also becomes a hyperparameter we want to optimize to improve the result of our machine learning models. Don't forget to dump any kinds of transformers you use at all the steps. You will need them to evaluate performance on the validation set. Next (or intermediate) major step is model selection + hyperparameter optimization. We generally use the following algorithms in the process of selecting a machine learning model: Which parameters should I optimize? How do I choose parameters closest to the best ones? These are a couple of questions people come up with most of the time. One cannot get answers to these questions without experience with different models + parameters on a large number of datasets. Also people who have experience are not willing to share their secrets. Luckily, I have quite a bit of experience too and I'm willing to give away some of the stuff. Let's break down the hyperparameters, model wise: RS* = Cannot say about proper values, go for Random Search in these hyperparameters. In my opinion, and strictly my opinion, the above models will out-perform any others and we don't need to evaluate any other models. Once again, remember to save the transformers: And apply them on validation set separately: The above rules and the framework has performed very well in most of the datasets I have dealt with. Of course, it has also failed for very complicated tasks. Nothing is perfect and we keep on improving on what we learn. Just like in machine learning.

One way to do that is to alter your leadership style to account for the (sometimes) fragile male ego. Should men accept powerful women and not feel threatened by them? Yes. Is that asking too much? IS IT? Sorry I didn't mean to get aggressive there. Anyhoo, here are 9 non-threatening leadership strategies for women. #1 When setting a deadline, ask your coworker what he thinks of doing something, instead of just asking him to get it done. This makes him feel less like you're telling them what to do and more like you care about his opinions. #2 When sharing your ideas, overconfidence is a killer. You don't want your male coworkers to think you're getting all uppity. Instead, downplay your ideas as just ""thinking out loud,"" ""throwing something out there,"" or sharing something ""dumb,"" ""random,"" or ""crazy."" #3 Pepper your emails with exclamation marks and emojis so you don't come across as too clear or direct. Your lack of efficient communication will make you seem more approachable. #4 If a male coworker steals your idea in a meeting, thank him for it. Give him kudos for how he explained your idea so clearly. And let's face it, no one might've ever heard it if he hadn't repeated it. #5 When you hear a sexist comment, the awkward laugh is key. Practice your awkward laugh at home, with your friends and family, and in the mirror. Make sure you sound truly delighted even as your soul is dying inside. #6 Men love explaining things. But when he's explaining something and you already know that, it might be tempting to say ""I already know that."" Instead, have him explain it to you over and over again. It will make him feel useful and will give you some time to think about out how to avoid him in the future. #7 Pointing out a mistake is always risky so it's important to always apologize for noticing the mistake and then make sure that no one thinks you're too sure about it. People will appreciate your ""hey what do I know?!"" sensibilities. #8 When collaborating with a man, type using only one finger. Skill and speed are very off-putting. #9 When all else fails, wear a mustache so everyone sees you as more man-like. This will cancel out any need to change your leadership style. In fact, you may even get a quick promotion!",en

Anna Blaylock and Navin Iyengar, both Product Designers at Netflix , shared insights gleaned from their years of A/B testing on tens of millions of Netflix members. They also showed some relevant examples from the product to help attendees think about their own designs. What follows is my recap of their presentation, along with some of my favorite takeaways. Experimentation I really liked this first slide of the presentation-I think it's smart to use an image from Breaking Bad to explain the concept of experimentation . The scientific method Hypothesis In science, a hypothesis is an idea or explanation that you then test through study and experimentation. In design, a theory or guess can also be called a hypothesis. The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome. It's something that can be tested, and those tests can be replicated. ""The general concept behind A/B testing is to create an experiment with a control group and one or more experimental groups (called 'cells' within Netflix) which receive alternative treatments. Each member belongs exclusively to one cell within a given experiment, with one of the cells always designated the 'default cell.' This cell represents the control group, which receives the same experience as all Netflix members not in the test.""  - The Netflix Tech Blog Here's how A/B testing is done at Netflix: As soon as the test is live, they track specific metrics of importance. For example, it could be elements like streaming hours and retention. Once the participants have provided enough meaningful conclusions, they move onto the efficacy of each test and define a winner out of the different variations. ""A/B testing is the most reliable way to learn user behaviors."" Experiment Many companies like Netflix run experiments to generate user data. It's also important to take time and effort to organize the experiment properly to ensure that both the type and amount of data is sufficient and available to clarify the questions of interest as efficiently as possible. You've probably noticed that the featured show on the Netflix homepage seems to change whenever you log in. They're all part of Netflix's complex experiments to get you to watch their shows. The idea of A/B testing is to present different content to different user groups, gather their reactions, and use the results to build strategies in the future. According to this blog post written by Netflix Engineer Gopal Krishnan , ""If you don't capture a member's attention within 90 seconds, that member will likely lose interest and move onto another activity. Such failed sessions could at times be because we did not show the right content or because we did show the right content but did not provide sufficient evidence as to why our member should watch it."" Netflix did an experiment back in 2013 to see if they could create a few artwork variants that increase the audience for a title. Here's the result: Krishnan adds, ""It was an early signal that members are sensitive to artwork changes. It was also a signal that there were better ways they could help Netflix members find the types of stories they were looking for within the Netflix experience."" Netflix later created a system that automatically grouped artwork that had different aspect ratios, crops, touch-ups, and localized title treatments but had the same background image. They replicated experiment on their other TV shows to track relative artwork performance. Here are some examples: Check out these 2 blog posts to learn more about Netflix's A/B testing: What I learned A/B testing is the most reliable way to learn user behaviors. As designers, we should think about our work through the lens of experimentation. When and why are you A/B testing? Once you have a design in production, use A/B testing to tweak the design and target 2 key metrics: retention and revenue. By A/B testing changes throughout the product and tracking users over time, you can see whether your change improves retention or increases revenue. If it does, make it the default. In this way A/B testing can be used to continuously improve business metrics. Are your users finding or doing one thing you want them to find or to do? My experience is that often, users cannot always complete a task as fast as you expect , and sometimes they can't even find a certain button you put on a page. The reasons can vary: It might be because the design isn't intuitive enough; the color isn't vibrant enough; the user isn't tech-savvy; they don't know how to make a decision because there are too many options on one page; and so on. Are your intuitions correct? Sadly, when it comes to user behavior, our intuitions could be wrong-and the only way to prove it is through A/B testing. A/B testing is the best way to validate whether one UX design is more effective than another. At work, our consumer product team proved that through A/B testing on our real estate website. For example, they wanted to figure out whether they can make a design change to improve the registration rate for users who clicked on a Google Ad. They created a few different experimental designs and tested them. They thought the design that only hides the property image would win, but they found that the design that hides both the property image and the price got the highest conversation rate. ""Knowing your user is the most exciting part of the design process."" Explore the boundaries. The best ideas come from many idea explorations. At work, our product team works collaboratively across many different projects. With so many parties involved (from designers to product managers to developers ), we get to explore the boundaries together. Some of the best ideas sometimes come from the developers or the product managers after they test out our prototypes. Observe what people do, not what they say. When talking to users, it's important to keep this in mind: They always say one thing, but they really do it differently. I conducted a few user testing sessions this week and have one perfect example to show you why. I had this one user testing out a contacts list view prototype and asked him if he usually sorts/filters his contacts. He said no because he wouldn't need do so. But when he discovered the new filters dropdown menu, he was amazed by how convenient it is to sort and filter multiple options at a time-and he immediately asked when that can roll out in production. Use data to estimate the size of opportunity. 1. It's always about the whys . Data can help shape ideas. Knowing your user is the most exciting part of the design process. There is no finished design, but many chances for iteration to improve the design and give our users the best experience possible. This post was originally published on Medium . Related posts",en

Today we are announcing that we're working with the Google Cloud Platform team to provide platform infrastructure for Spotify, everywhere. This is a big deal. At Spotify we are obsessed with providing a streaming experience that feels as though you have all the music in the world on your phone. Historically, we've taken a traditional approach to doing this: buying or leasing data-center space, server hardware and networking gear as close to our customers as possible. This approach has allowed us to give you music instantly, wherever you are in the world. But in a business growing quickly in users, markets and features, keeping pace with scaling demands requires ever increasing amounts of focus and effort. Like good, lazy engineers, we occasionally asked ourselves: do we really need to do all this stuff? For a long time the answer was ""yes."" Operating our own data-centers may be a pain, but the core cloud services were not at a level of quality, performance and cost that would make cloud a significantly better option for Spotify in the long run. As they say: better the devil you know... Recently that balance has shifted. The storage, compute and network services available from cloud providers are as high quality, high performance and low cost as what the traditional approach provides. This makes the move to the cloud a no-brainer for us. Google, in our experience, has an edge here, but it's a competitive space and we expect the big players to be battling it out for the foreseeable future. What really tipped the scales towards Google for us, however, has been our experience with Google's data platform and tools. Good infrastructure isn't just about keeping things up and running, it's about making all of our teams more efficient and more effective, and Google's data stack does that for us in spades. Google has long been a thought-leader in this space, and this shows in the sophistication and quality of its data offerings . From traditional batch processing with Dataproc, to rock-solid event delivery with Pub/Sub to the nearly magical abilities of BigQuery, building on Google's data infrastructure provides us with a significant advantage where it matters the most. We have a large and complex backend, so this is a large and complex project that will take us some time to complete. We're looking forward to sharing our experiences with you as we go, so watch our engineering blog for more information on what we learn, build and break along the way. We're pretty excited about our Googley future and hope you'll find it interesting too.",en

Ao contrário dos outros profissionais, ele é cego. Com o auxílio da audição e da tecnologia, ele prova ser capaz de exercer com maestria a profissão que escolheu, apesar da limitação. ""Fotografia é sensibilidade"", ele afirma. (veja o depoimento dele no vídeo acima) João ficou cego em 2004, aos 28 anos, em decorrência de um caso grave de uveíte bilateral - uma inflamação na camada média do globo ocular. Ele não enxerga com o olho direito, que sofreu descolamento de retina. Já o olho esquerdo tem uma lesão no nervo ótico, além de glaucoma. Clinicamente cego, ele só é capaz de enxergar vultos coloridos à uma distância de até um metro. Por causa do problema ocular, João faz tratamento periódico no Hospital das Clínicas de São Paulo. Ele começou a fotografar quatro anos depois de ficar cego. ""A audição me ajuda e o contraste de cores me facilita"", explicou João sobre o desafio de fotografar sem enxergar. Ele opera uma câmera profissional com o auxílio de um telefone celular que possui comandos de voz e o indica onde está cada comando do equipamento. ""As pessoas me perguntam se faz diferença fotografar com uma câmera ou com um celular. Mas o que faz a diferença é quem está por trás do equipamento. Como você compõe a foto, imagina a foto. Tudo isso passa pela minha cabeça"", revelou. João Maia em ação na cobertura da Paralimpíada (Foto: Reprodução/ Internet) Superação Nascido na cidade de Bom Jesus, no Piauí, João Maia se mudou para São Paulo há 20 anos em busca de melhores condições de vida. Na capital paulista, ele concluiu o curso técnico em agropecuária. O sonho de ingressar numa faculdade só foi realizado após o problema de saúde que lhe tirou a visão. ""É engraçado como a vida traça caminhos diferentes. Eu só concluí o curso de licenciatura em história depois que eu fiquei deficiente visual, aos 33 anos. Por isso que eu digo: nunca é tarde para voltar e começar"", destacou João, que ingressou no ensino superior graças a uma bolsa de estudos para atletas. Acostumado a fotografar eventos esportivos, participar da Paralimpíada é o ponto alto da carreira de João Maia. As competições de goalball e futebol de cinco são suas favoritas. ""Todo mundo tem que ficar em silêncio, aí a gente tem que ouvir o guizo da bola. Aí é perfeito para fotografar, porque eu vou seguindo o som com o guizo e tem o contraste das cores, o que proporciona uma imagem de qualidade"", contou João.

This science-practitioner gap explains our disappointing state of affairs. Leaders should drive employee engagement, yet only 30% of employees are engaged, costing the U.S. economy $550 billion a year in productivity loss. Moreover, a large global survey of employee attitudes toward management suggests that a whopping 82% of people don't trust their boss . You only need to google ""my boss is..."" or ""my manager is..."" and see what the autocomplete text is to get a sense of what most people think of their leaders. Unsurprisingly, over 50% of employees quit their job because of their managers . As the old saying goes, ""people join companies, but quit their bosses."" And the rate of derailment, unethical incidents, and counterproductive work behaviors among leaders is so high that it is hard to be shocked by a leader's dark side. Research indicates that 30%-60% of leaders act destructively, with an estimated cost of $1-$2.7 million for each failed senior manager. Part of the problem is that many widely held beliefs about leadership are incongruent with the scientific evidence. As Mark Twain allegedly noted, ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" For example, it is quite common for people to believe that leadership is largely dependent on the situation, that it's hard to predict whether someone will be a good (or bad) leader, and that any person can be a leader. In reality, some people have a much higher probability of becoming leaders, regardless of the context, and this probability can be precisely quantified with robust psychological tools. What do we really know about the measurement of leadership potential? Here are some critical findings: Who becomes a leader? Although leaders come in many shapes, a few personality characteristics consistently predict whether someone is likely to emerge as a leader. As the most widely cited meta-analysis in this area shows, people who are more adjusted, sociable, ambitious, and curious are much more likely to become leaders. (53% of the variability in leadership emergence is explained by these personality factors.) Unsurprisingly, higher levels of cognitive ability (IQ) also increase an individual's likelihood to emerge as a leader, though by less than 5%. Of course, emergence doesn't imply effectiveness , but one has to emerge in order to be effective. What are the key qualities of effective leaders? The ultimate measure of leader effectiveness is the performance of the leader's team or organization , particularly vis-à-vis competitors. Leadership is a resource for the group, and effective leaders enable a group to outperform other groups. While the same personality and ability traits described above help leaders become more effective - they are not just advantageous for emergence - the best leaders also show higher levels of integrity , which enables them to create a fair and just culture in their teams and organizations. In addition, effective leaders are generally more emotionally intelligent , which enables them to stay calm under pressure and have better people skills. Conversely, narcissistic leaders are more prone to behaving in unethical ways, which is likely to harm their teams. How will the person lead? Not everyone leads in the same way. Leadership style is largely dependent on personality. Ambitious, thick-skinned leaders tend to be more entrepreneurial , so they are focused on growth and innovation. Curious, sociable, and sensitive leaders tend to be more charismatic , though charisma often reflects dark side traits , such as narcissism and psychopathy. Studies also highlight gender differences in leadership styles, with men being more transactional and women more transformational. However, gender roles are best understood as a psychological and normally distributed variable, as people differ in masculinity and femininity regardless of their biological sex. Are leaders born or made? Any observable pattern of human behaviors is the byproduct of genetic and environmental influences, so the answer to this question is ""both."" Estimates suggest that leadership is 30%-60% heritable , largely because the character traits that shape leadership - personality and intelligence - are heritable . While this suggests strong biological influences on leadership, it does not imply that nurture is trivial. Even more-heritable traits, such as weight (80%) and height (90%), are affected by environmental factors. Although there is no clear recipe for manipulating the environment in order to boost leadership potential, well-crafted coaching interventions boost critical leadership competencies by about 20%-30%. What is the role of culture? Culture is key because it drives employee engagement and performance . However, culture isn't the cause of leadership so much as the result of it . Thus leaders create the explicit and implicit rules of interaction for organizational members, and these rules affect morale and productivity levels . When people's values are closely aligned with the values of the organization (and leadership), they will experience higher levels of fit and purpose . How early can we predict potential? Any prediction is a measure of potential or the probability of something happening. Because leadership is partly dependent on genetic and early childhood experiences , predicting it from an early age is certainly possible. Whether doing so is ethical or legal is a different question. However, most of the commonly used indicators to gauge leadership potential - educational achievement, emotional intelligence, ambition, and IQ - can be predicted from a very early age, so it would be naïve to treat them as more malleable. Perhaps in the future, leadership potential will be assessed at a very early age by inspecting people's saliva. Does gender matter? Less than we think. The fact that so many leaders are male has much more to do with social factors (people's expectations, cultural norms, and opportunities) than actual gender differences in leadership potential, which are virtually nonexistent . In fact, some studies have shown that women are slightly more effective as leaders on the job, but this may be because the standards for appointing women to leadership positions are higher than those for appointing men, which creates a surplus of incompetent men in leadership positions. The solution is not to get women to act more like men, but to select leaders based on their actual competence. Why do leaders derail? We cannot ignore the wide range of undesirable and toxic outcomes associated with leadership. It is not the absence of bright side qualities, but rather their coexistence with dark side tendencies , that makes leaders derail. Indeed, as Sepp Blatter, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and Bernie Madoff demonstrate, technical brilliance often coexists with self-destructive and other destructive traits. This is just one reason why it is so important for leadership development and executive coaching interventions to highlight leaders' weaknesses , and help them keep their toxic tendencies in check. Although these findings have been replicated in multiple studies, a skeptic could ask, ""Now that we're (allegedly) living in an era of unprecedented technological change, could some of these findings be outdated?"" Not really. Leadership evolved over millions of years , enabling us to function as group-living animals. It is therefore unlikely that the core foundations of leadership will change. That said, the specific skills and qualities that enable leaders and their groups to adapt to the world are certainly somewhat context dependent. For example, just as physical strength mattered more, and intellectual ability less, in the past, it is conceivable that human differentiators such as curiosity, empathy, and creativity will become more important in a world of ever-growing technological dependence and ubiquitous artificial intelligence. In short, the science of leadership is well established. There is no real need to advance it in order to improve real-world practices. We should focus instead on applying what we already know, and ignoring what we think we know that isn't true.",en

Portrait: Jeremy Martin October 5, 2011: Steve Jobs dies at the age of 56, in his home in Palo Alto, California. Jobs' official cause of death is respiratory arrest arising from complications related to a rare type of pancreatic cancer, with which he was diagnosed eight years earlier. He officially stepped down from his role as Apple's CEO in August, 2011 . An unsentimental man With so much written about Jobs in the years since he died, and so much material to write about, it's impossible to summarize Jobs' life in a short article. To me, one of the most notable things about his death was how much it meant to people all over the world. If anyone thought of tech as a niche hobby in 2011, they can't have been thinking that after the public outpouring of grief which met the news about Steve. Steve Jobs himself was not sentimental. When he left Apple in the mid-1980s, he didn't return to clear his office, which meant personal mementos like his first Apple stock certificate , which had hung on his wall, being tossed in the trash. Shortly after he returned to the company he co-founded in the late 1990s, he gave Apple's historical archive - comprising records that management at Apple had kept since the mid-1980s - to Stanford University Libraries because he didn't want the company to be fixated on the past. A few years after that, in 1996, an ex-Apple employee named David Pakman who had worked there from 1991 through 1997 emailed Steve to suggest staging a celebratory event for Apple's thirtieth birthday. He received a simple answer: David, Apple is focused on the future, not the past. -Steve This attitude extended to Jobs' view of himself - and his own legacy. He apparently "" made his view ... very clear "" that Apple shouldn't name its new Spaceship campus - for which he made one of his last public appearance speaking in favor of - after him. He also spent much of his latter tenure at Apple establishing a company that could run without his presence. As Tim Cook told the authors of the biography Becoming Steve Jobs , ""[Steve] didn't want us asking, 'What would Steve do?' He abhorred the way the Disney culture stagnated after Walt Disney's death, and he was determined for that not to happen at Apple."" Nor was he under any illusions that he was creating work that people would obsess over for years after he was gone, despite the fact that he was a perfectionist for getting them right during his life. In a 1994 interview, when Jobs was 39, he told the interviewer that, ""All the work that I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I am 50."" Whether he was right or not (and, in technical terms at least, he was), this was the way he felt. Life after Steve All of which goes some way to saying why it was so heartening that Jobs' death received so much attention. He wasn't the richest technology CEO to die, but it showed that his life - faults and all - had meant a lot to a great number of people. Jobs had helped bring about products that people cared about, and in turn they cared about him. A lot has changed at Apple since Jobs died, which is exactly what he made clear he wanted to happen. Gauntlets he laid down about never wanting to see a stylus on an iPad have been, wonderfully, proved wrong with the Apple Pencil. As someone who always pushed engineers to prove him wrong, I'd have to think Jobs couldn't have been any happier with the result. We're also well beyond the need for the Mac to be a "" digital hub ,"" and Apple is embracing environmentalism and other issues with a passion Jobs didn't exhibit for them. But it's still the same company Jobs imbued with a strong vision back in the 1980s (and arguably the late 70s), and which it still personifies today. And, hey, the product lines he set in motion continue to be extremely profitable - as do the movies made by Pixar, which Jobs helped bring to prominence. What are your resounding memories of Steve Jobs? Where were you when you heard he had passed away? What was his single biggest achievement, in your view? Leave your comments below.",en

In this talk we're going to explore application performance from the bottom. Looking at the real world performance impact of Swift features (Protocols, Generics, Structs, and Classes) in the context of data parsing, mapping, and persistence, we will identify the key bottlenecks as well as the performance gains that Swift gives us. Introduction (0:00) I'm going to talk to you about Swift performance. When building software, especially mobile software where people are distracted and busy, they want to get on with their life rather than deal with your application. It's frustrating when apps are slow, and don't do what users want when they want to do it. So it's important to make your code fast. What makes code slow? When you're writing code and choosing your abstractions, it's important to be cognizant of the implications of those abstractions. I'm going to start out by talking about how to understand the trade-offs between opting-in to dynamic versus static dispatch and how things will be allocated, and how to choose the best fit for you. One of the biggest, and often unavoidable costs in code, is object allocation and deallocation. Swift will automatically allocate and deallocate memory for you, and there are two types of allocation. First is stack-based allocation . When it can, Swift will allocate memory on the stack. The stack is a super simple data structure; you push from the end of it and pop from the top of it. Because you can only mutate the ends of the stack, you can implement it by keeping a pointer to the end, and allocating and deallocating memory from it is a case of reassigning that integer. Then we have heap allocation . This allows you to allocate memory with a far more dynamic lifetime, but requires a much more complex data structure. To allocate memory on the heap you have to lock up a free block in the heap with enough size to hold your object. You find the unused block, and then you allocate that, and when you want to deallocate memory you have to search for where to reinsert the block. That's slow. Mostly because you have to lock and synchronize things for the purpose of thread safety. Reference counting (2:30) We also have reference counting which is slightly less expensive, but happens way more often, so it's still a pain. Reference counting is the mechanism used in Objective-C and Swift to determine when it's safe to release objects. These days, reference counting is forced to be automatic in Swift, which means it's much easier to ignore, however, then you work in instruments where your code is being slow, and you see 20,000 calls to Swift retainers with release, taking up 90% of the time. That's because if you have this function that takes an object and does a thing with the object, the compiler will automatically insert a retain-and-release so the object doesn't go away during the lifetime of your method. These retains-and-releases are atomic operations, and therefore have to be slow. Or rather, we don't know how to make them much faster than they already are. Dispatch and objects (3:28) Then we also have dispatch. Swift has three types of dispatch. It will inline functions where possible, and then there's no additional cost to having that function. The calls are just there. Static dispatch through a V-table is essentially a lookup and a jump and takes about one nanosecond. And then dynamic dispatch that takes about five nanoseconds, which isn't really a problem when you only have a few method calls, but if you're inside a nested loop or performing thousands of operations then it starts to add up. Swift also has two main types of objects. You have classes, and with a class everything will be allocated on the heap. As you can see here, we have a class that is an index. It has two properties, a section and an item. When we create that, the stack has a pointer to the index, and on the heap we have the section and the item. If we make another reference to that, then we have two pointers to the same area on the heap and its shared memory. We'll also automatically insert a retain for your second reference to the object. A lot of people will say that structs are the easiest way to write fast Swift code, and that's generally a good thing to have because they'll try to put things on the stack and you can often have static or inline dispatch. Swift structs have three words on the stack for storage. If your struct has three or fewer properties then the struct's values will generally be inline on the stack. A word is the size of a built-in integer on your CPU, and it's the chunks that the CPU will work in. As you can see here, when we create the struct, the index struct with the section and the item the values are directly down on the stack and no extra allocation has occurred. What happens when we assign things elsewhere? If we assign P-2 to P, we simply copy the values that are already in the stack again, and we don't share the reference. This is where we get value semantics from. What happens if we have a reference type in our struct? A struct has the inline pointers. Then when we assign it elsewhere we have the same pointers shared across the two structs and we have two retains to the pointers, rather than a single retain on the object. This is more expensive than if you had a class, for example, with the same result. Abstractions (6:59) As we said before, Swift provides a lot of different abstractions that allow you to make your own decisions about how code should be run and its performance characteristics. No we're going to look at how this applies to actual code. Here's some simple code: We have a circle with a radius and a center. It has three words of storage, and it will be on the stack. We create one hundred million of them and then we loop over those circles and call a single function. On my computer this takes 0.3 seconds in release mode. What happens when the requirements change? Rather than just drawing circles, our code now needs to be able to handle multiple types of shapes. Let's say we need to draw lines. We're super excited about protocol-oriented programming because it allows us to have polymorphism without inheritance and it allows us to think about the types. What we techs like to do is extract that out into a protocol, and the simple change of referencing the array by the protocol now makes the code take 4.0 seconds to run. That's a 1300% slowdown. Why? This is because the code that was previously able to be statically dispatched and executed without any heap applications cannot be done. This is because of how protocols are implemented. For example, here you can see that all we know about is our circle. What the Swift compiler will do is either go though the V-table or inline the draw function directly inside the for-loop. When we reference it by the protocol it doesn't know whether the object is a struct or a class. It could be anything that conforms to that protocol. How do we go about dispatching the draw function? The answer lies in the protocol witness table. It's an object with a known layout that is generated for every protocol performance in your application, and this table essentially acts as an alias for the underlying implementation. In this code here, how do we actually get to the protocol witness table? The answer is the existential container which for now has three words of storage for structs that fit inside the value buffer and then a reference to the protocol witness table. Here our circle fits inside the three word buffer and won't be referenced separately, Our line, for example, which has four words of storage because it has two points and my slide is basically source kit service terminated. This line struct requires more than four words of storage. How do we do that? How does that affect the performance of this code? Well, this happens: It takes 45 seconds to execute. Why does this take so much longer and why is that happening? A portion of that time is spent allocating the structs because now they don't fit within that three-word buffer. That storage will be allocated on the heap, but it's also partially related to how protocol works, again. Because the existential container only has three words of storage for structs or a reference to an object, we also need to have something called the value witness table. This is what we use to handle arbitrary values. A value witness table is also created and then it has three words of storage for the value buffer, for any inline structs, and it generalizes allocation, copying, destruction and the deallocation of a value or class. What we have here is an example of some code and then what will be generated from it. If we just had a draw function, that took a value and then we create the line, and then we pass it to the drawable function. What actually happens is it passes the drawable existential container and then that'll be created again, inside the function. It'll copy the value and protocol witness table, and then allocate a new buffer and copy the value of the other struct, or class, or whatever that object is. Then it'll use the draw function on the protocol witness table and pass the actual drawable. You can see that the value witness table and the protocol witness table will be over here on the stack and the line will be on the heap and as will the line drawable. Modelling your data / Conclusion (12:15) Simple changes in the way we model data can have a huge impact on performance. Let's look at some ways to avoid these costs. Let's talk about generics. You're going to say, but you just showed us that protocols could be really slow, why would we want to use generics? The answer comes from what generics allow us to do. Say we have this stack struct that is generic of a T , which is constrained by some type, which would be a protocol. What the compiler will do is replace that T with the protocol or the concrete class that you're passing to it. Do that all of the way down the function chain and it will create specialized versions of that code that operate directly on the type. You no longer need to go through the value witness table, or the protocol witness table, and you eradicate the existential container, which could be a really nice way to still write really fast generic code and have the really nice polymorphism that Swift gives us. That's called static polymorphism. You can also improve a lot of your data model by using enumerations rather than having lots of strings from the server. For example, if you were building a social network and had a bunch of accounts that needed a status, previously you might have had that as a raw string on the type. If you had an enum for that then you don't actually need to allocate anything there and then when you're passing it around you're just passing the value from the enum, which can be a really nice way to speed up your code as well as having safer, more readable code throughout your application. Also, it can be super useful to have actual domain-specific models in the form of u-models or presenters, or various other types of abstraction that allow you to cut out a lot of the cruft that you don't need in your app. I think I've run slightly short, but thank you very much.",en

Photo: IBM IBM has now deployed over 90,000 Macs since joining forces with Apple in July 2014 , and it is on track to surpass the 100,000 milestone in early 2017. As its Mac user base rises, the company has found that the need for technical support has fallen. An update on IBM's partnership with Apple, which sees it deploying 1,300 Macs every week, was provided at the annual JAMF Nation User Conference on Wednesday. Not only has IBM been pushing Macs, but also over 48,000 iPads and over 81,000 iPhones. This takes the total number of Apple devices used by IBM to over 217,000, and yet only 50 support staff are required to provide assistance for those devices worldwide. That's because just 5 percent of Macs end up requiring deskside support, compared to 27 percent of PCs. In fact, PC users drive twice the number of support calls, IBM says. It's no wonder, then, that as the number of Macs deployed by IBM rises, its rate of support tickets has fallen. Back in June 2015 when the program first started, and less than 9,000 Macs had been deployed, around 7.6 percent of users required technical support. As of September 2016, when 85,000 Macs were in use at IBM, only 3.2 percent of users needed assistance. This is saving IBM a pretty penny. Last October, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that the company is saving around $270 in support costs with every Mac it rolls out. Macs might be more expensive to purchase, then, but they're well worth it over time. Alongside IBM's adoption of Mac and iOS devices, the company has been developing enterprise apps for iPhone and iPad under the MobileFirst initiative . It now offers over 100 native apps tailored to serve the needs of multiple industries. Via: AppleInsider",en

Uma das razões foram melhores preços das commodities. Em relação ao segundo trimestre do ano, entretanto, o lucro foi 48% menor, tendo em vista que no mesmo intervalo do ano passado a companhia teve um impulso em seu resultado devido a variação cambial. O Ebitda (juros antes de impostos, depreciação e amortização) foi de R$ 9,829 bilhões no intervalo de julho a setembro deste ano, aumento de 44% na relação anual e de 18% na trimestral. ""O resultado da Vale neste trimestre foi 'limpo'. Tivemos um excelente resultado operacional e forte geração de caixa"", frisou o diretor-Executivo de Finanças e Relação com Investidores da mineradora Luciano Siani, em vídeo disponibilizado no site da companhia. ""Não tivemos nesse trimestre nenhum impacto de variação cambial e de provisões, sem efeitos extraordinários"", concluiu. A receita operacional líquida no terceiro trimestre ficou em R$ 23,772 bilhões, aumento de 2% na relação anual e também na trimestral. O lucro da companhia veio abaixo das expectativas de analistas, mas tanto o Ebitda quanto a receita vieram em linha. Focada em diminuir seu endividamento, a dívida líquida da Vale era de US$ 25,965 bilhões no fim de setembro, representando um aumento de 7% na relação anual, mas uma queda de 6% na base comparativa trimestral. Siani destacou que a Vale vem mostrando fortalecimento do seu balanço. Os investimentos da Vale no terceiro trimestre do ano caíram 33% e foram a US$ 1,257 bilhões. Em relação ao segundo trimestre houve queda de 8%. No acumulado do ano até setembro os investimentos chegaram a US$ 4,074 bilhões, diminuição de 34% ante o observado no mesmo período de 2014. A companhia vem revisando sua estimativa de investimento para o ano. A última mudança ocorreu em setembro, quando informou ao mercado que planejava investir US$ 4,5 bilhões, abaixo dos US$ 5,8 bilhões previstos para este ano. Ainda com essa perspectiva, a companhia divulgou na semana passada, quando publicou seu relatório de produção, que havia reduzido mais uma vez sua estimativa de produção de minério de ferro para 2017 para ficar entre 360 milhões de toneladas e 380 milhões de toneladas.",pt

É grande a lista de crimes cometidos por juízes e desembargadores em todo o país que levou o CNJ (Conselho Nacional de Justiça) a determinar a aposentadoria compulsória de 48 magistrados desde 2008. A punição por aposentadoria compulsória custa aos cofres públicos anualmente R$ 16,4 milhões em pensões vitalícias e valores brutos, conforme levantamento inédito feito pelo UOL . O montante gasto com os 48 magistrados condenados pelo CNJ daria para pagar com folga durante três anos os salários dos 11 ministros do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal). Eles custam, juntos, cerca de R$ 5 milhões por ano entre vencimentos e impostos. Em valores líquidos, após o desconto de impostos, a folha salarial dos ministros cai para R$ 3,2 milhões por ano. A remuneração dos magistrados punidos pelo CNJ fica em R$ 11,85 milhões anuais. O valor médio recebido anualmente por juiz ou desembargador condenado com a aposentadoria compulsória varia de R$ 237 mil a R$ 329 mil, conforme a diferença entre vencimentos líquido e bruto. Os valores mensais foram multiplicados por 13 meses para chegar ao total anual, considerando o 13º salário. Os dados foram coletados pelo UOL nos sites de transparência dos tribunais brasileiros e, em alguns casos, em valores informados pelas assessorias de imprensa dos órgãos judiciários. Duas resoluções do CNJ determinam total transparência na folha de pagamentos dos tribunais. Mas nem todos cumprem a determinação. Os Tribunais de Justiça da Paraíba e do Rio de Janeiro não disponibilizam os dados. A reportagem procurou as assessorias para acessar os números, mas não obteve resposta. Uma servidora que pediu para não ser identificada disse que foi ""repreendida"" por solicitar os dados internamente. Para o ex-corregedor do CNJ Gilson Dipp, a dificuldade em ter acesso a informações que deveriam ser públicas ocorre porque ""a Justiça não tem muita transparência"". Alan Marques/Folhapress 'Disparate' O período de Dipp à frente da corregedoria nacional, entre os meses de setembro de 2008 e 2010, foi o de maior punição de magistrados. Ele participou de 18 afastamentos compulsórios, incluindo o do ex-ministro do STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justiça) Paulo Medina por venda de sentenças para beneficiar empresários de bingos ilegais. Dipp, que foi também ministro do STJ, considera o montante pago a magistrados afastados por atos ilícitos um ""disparate"" que contribui para reforçar na sociedade o sentimento de que a aposentadoria compulsória é um ""prêmio"" a corruptos. Já o presidente da AMB (Associação dos Magistrados Brasileiros), João Ricardo Costa, defende a manutenção das aposentadorias. ""Essa regra traz muito mais ganhos para a sociedade do que fatos isolados que nós temos no país"", diz. A sociedade não perdoa juiz corrupto. É repugnante até para quem corrompe Eliana Calmon, ex-presidente do CNJ A aposentadoria compulsória é a pena máxima prevista na Loman (Lei Orgânica da Magistratura Nacional), criada em 1979 e incorporada pela Constituição de 1988. É uma medida administrativa, sem efeito penal imediato, e o pagamento só pode ser suspenso caso o magistrado seja condenado pela Justiça comum. Embora desde 2012 o STF tenha decidido que magistrados aposentados não têm direito a foro privilegiado, a condenação no CNJ não gera uma ação penal automaticamente. É preciso que o Ministério Público, um tribunal ou mesmo um cidadão acione a Justiça para investigar o magistrado fora do âmbito administrativo. No geral, os casos envolvendo juízes e desembargadores caem no esquecimento após sair do CNJ. Costa avalia que a punição administrativa é importante para evitar que os magistrados fiquem à mercê de pressões políticas e econômicas locais, uma vez que as investigações começam nos tribunais espalhados pelo país antes de chegar ao CNJ. O dirigente da AMB cita um caso no Acre, onde um juiz endureceu nas decisões contra nepotismo e sofreu retaliações. ""A punição administrativa é feita pela administração do tribunal, que pode ser pressionada pelo poder político local, pelo governo do Estado etc. Por isso tem toda uma justificativa para que o juiz não seja demitido pelo processo administrativo"", diz. Dipp sugere uma revisão na legislação para suspender os pagamentos em casos mais graves, como a venda de sentença. ""O desejável é que não houvesse nenhum benefício [como a aposentadoria compulsória após comprovação de ilicitudes]. Isso é terrível, mas está previsto na lei. O Judiciário tem vantagens [financeiras] decorrentes de leis ou de decisões judiciais que não deveriam existir"", afirma. O dirigente da AMB defende uma reforma no sistema recursal, que permite um número elevado ações para protelar decisões definitivas. ""O problema todo é que temos um sistema processual em que os processos não terminam nunca, principalmente em situações que envolvem agentes políticos, grandes empresários e também a magistratura"", diz. Elza Fiúza/Agência Brasil 'Bandidos de toga' A venda de sentença é a principal causa de afastamento de magistrados pelo CNJ, que inclusive já condenou três vezes o mesmo desembargador pelo crime. Autora da expressão ""bandidos de toga"" para se referir aos magistrados corruptos, a ex-corregedora do CNJ e ex-ministra do STJ Eliana Calmon diz que pouca coisa mudou desde quando fez a afirmação, quando comandava a apuração de infrações cometidas por magistrados entre 2010 e 2012. ""A sociedade não perdoa juiz corrupto. É repugnante até para quem corrompe"", afirma. Para Eliana Calmon, é preciso mudar a Lei Orgânica da Magistratura Nacional para haver mais rigor na punição de ilegalidades praticadas por juízes e desembargadores. ""É necessário separar as maçãs podres para fortalecer o Judiciário com ainda mais credibilidade popular, como vem acontecendo depois da Lava Jato. Isso não exclui os juízes corruptos que se escondem, se protegem por detrás das garantias da magistratura. Este foi o sentido da frase que cunhei ao me referir aos bandidos de toga"", recomenda. A revisão da Loman, contudo, ganhou os holofotes recentemente depois que o presidente do Senado, Renan Calheiros (PMDB-AL), pediu ao presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), para ""agilizar"" a votação da proposta de emenda constitucional (PEC 53/2011). Marcos Corrêa/Presidência Temer (ao centro) faz reunião com Cármen Lúcia e Renan Calheiros após pressão no Congresso para mudar lei que permite demissão de magistrado A emenda foi aprovada no Senado em 2013, prevendo a cassação dos vencimentos de magistrados condenados pelo CNJ ao criar a possibilidade de ""demissão"" no âmbito da magistratura. O texto dormitava nos escaninhos da Câmara, mas ressurgiu com a eclosão da Operação Lava Jato. Renan defendeu a PEC como ""uma medida fundamental de combate à corrupção e à impunidade"" dos magistrados e para acabar com o ""prêmio"" representado pela ""aposentadoria por juiz e membro do Ministério Público"" que cometeram crimes. Dipp avalia que a iniciativa do Congresso fere a Constituição, uma vez que esta define o STF como órgão que deva sugerir um projeto de lei regulamentando uma nova Loman. Na madrugada do dia 30, deputados federais aprovaram o texto-base do pacote de medidas anticorrupção proposto pelo Ministério Público . Com os novos tópicos apresentados e a derrubada de outros tantos, o projeto ficou desfigurado e foi criticado por várias instâncias do Judiciário, como a Procuradoria-Geral da República e a presidente do STF . Ele prevê punição a magistrados por abuso de autoridade . O Poder Judiciário não está nem além nem aquém de qualquer outro sacrifício que o povo brasileiro e as instituições venham a passar Gilson Dipp, ex-ministro do STJ e ex-corregedor do CNJ Mas o ex-corregedor do CNJ critica a demora do STF em propor a lei. Nas contas de Dipp, o Supremo discute o tema internamente há mais de 15 anos. ""Acho que o Judiciário já deveria ter ditado a adequação da nova Loman, consentânea com os tempos atuais. A Loman atual é antiquada e de certa maneira é corporativista"", avalia. Eliana Calmon também defende mudanças, ressaltando que há casos em que a aposentadoria compulsória é uma boa medida para servidores públicos em geral, inclusive no Judiciário. ""É imprescindível que se façam correções na Loman"", diz. A ex-ministra do STJ sugere uma nova legislação que crie multas para infrações menores, exija o ressarcimento de dinheiro público desviado e suspenda o direito de magistrados voltarem por novo concurso. ""Conheço juiz aposentado compulsoriamente por corrupção e que prestou novo concurso. Era juiz estadual e, após a punição administrativa, fez concurso para juiz federal. Se houvesse impedimento legal, ele não mais poderia fazer concurso, pelo menos para a magistratura"", conta. Penduricalhos A folha de pagamento com os compulsórios pode ser ainda maior se considerar gratificações e indenizações pagas pelos tribunais regionais. São os chamados ""penduricalhos"". O Tribunal de Justiça do Amazonas pagou neste ano, por exemplo, de R$ 10 mil a R$ 18 mil a cada um de quatro juízes aposentados por decisão do CNJ. Os valores aparecem na folha de pagamento apenas como ""vantagens pessoais"". A situação permite a um ex-desembargador do TJ-AM ampliar substancialmente os seus vencimentos. O salário fixo dele é de R$ 30.471,11 por mês, mas, com o recebimento nos últimos meses de R$ 10 mil como ""gratificação"", o ganho mensal sobe para R$ 38.261,05. Em maio deste ano, ele recebeu R$ 15,8 mil em gratificação, que, somados à parcela do 13º, fizeram sua renda líquida atingir R$ 46.404,63. Em resposta, o TJ-AM disse ""que o valor de R$ 15.788,49 corresponde à Parcela Autônoma de Equivalência, no montante de R$ 10 mil, paga em cumprimento à decisão judicial, assim como acontece em todos os tribunais do país, devida aos magistrados ativos e inativos; e o valor de R$ 5.788,49, concedido por decisão administrativa que corresponde a uma diferença de subsídio do ano de 2005 autorizada pela Lei 3.506/2010, de 17/05/2010, cujo término do pagamento se deu em junho de 2016"". São esses penduricalhos nos salários que fazem o Judiciário pagar, em muitos casos, mais que o teto permitido pela Constituição, que é o vencimento bruto de ministro do STF: R$ 33.763. Dipp afirma que ""tem certos benefícios que não podem ser recebidos pelos aposentados, mas vários tribunais estão pagando"". O Tribunal de Justiça do Estado de Santa Catarina (TJ-SC) reforçou, em agosto, por exemplo, o contracheque de um ex-desembargador com bonificação de R$ 11.516,34. Foi o repasse da Parcela Autônoma de Equivalência (PAE), concedido pelo órgão catarinense a seus magistrados para corrigir perda salarial com a URV (Unidade Real de Valor), adotada em 1994 para fazer a transição do cruzeiro para o real. Ele foi afastado pelo CNJ em junho de 2014. Ele perdeu o cargo por não denunciar a exploração sexual de uma adolescente. A Polícia Federal identificou que ele sabia de relações de um amigo com uma garota de programa de 16 anos. O ex-magistrado catarinense recebe mais de R$ 22,5 mil líquidos como aposentadoria, mas custa mais de R$ 30,3 mil ao TJ-SC, entre vencimento e impostos. Ele recebe mensalmente outros R$ 300 como auxílio-saúde. Em nota, o TJ-SC confirmou o benefício da ""restituição de contribuição do Instituto de Previdência de Santa Catarina, cobrado de forma equivocada em relação aos magistrados, e naquele instante [agosto] recomposto ao patrimônio dos anteriormente prejudicados, em conformidade com a legislação vigente"". Para o ex-corregedor do CNJ, a crise econômica impõe mais rigor ao Judiciário com esse tipo de ""penduricalho"" e deveria partir do STF a revisão dos benefícios. ""O ajuste fiscal [conduzido pelo governo federal], não importa quem seja o causador, deve corresponder a todo o serviço público."" O presidente da AMB defende um enxugamento nos benefícios dos magistrados. Ele avalia que o ideal é uma combinação de salário mais o adicional por tempo de serviço, que englobaria o auxílio moradia pago hoje a magistrados da ativa. ""O que queremos é uma política mais estável para a magistratura. O Congresso entende isso, mas não se direciona para criar essa estrutura legal"", diz João Ricardo Costa.

In this opinion piece, Greenspan discusses blockchain-enabled smart contracts and why this application of the technology may be suffering from inflated expectations. As the developer of a popular blockchain platform, I sometimes gets asked whether Ethereum-like smart contracts are on the MultiChain roadmap. The answer I always give is always: 'No, or at least not yet'. But in the hype-filled world of blockchains, smart contracts are all the rage, so why ever not? Well, the problem is, while we now know of three strong use cases for permissioned bitcoin-style blockchains (provenance, company recordkeeping and lightweight finance), we've yet to find the equivalent for Ethereum smart contracts. It's not that people don't understand what they want smart contracts to do. Rather, it's that so many of these ideas are simply impossible. When smart people hear the term ""smart contracts"", their imaginations tend to run wild. They conjure up dreams of autonomous intelligent software, going off into the world, taking data along for the ride. Unfortunately, the reality of smart contracts is more mundane. A smart contract is a piece of code that is stored on an blockchain, triggered by blockchain transactions and which reads and writes data in that blockchain's database. That's it. Really. A smart contract is just a fancy name for code that runs on a blockchain, and interacts with that blockchain's state. And what is the code? It's Pascal, it's Python, it's PHP. It's Java, it's Fortran, it's C++. If we're talking databases, it's stored procedures written in an extension of SQL. All of these languages are fundamentally equivalent, solving the same sorts of problems in the same sorts of ways. Of course, each has its strengths and weaknesses - you'd be crazy to build a website in C or compress HD video in Ruby. But in principle at least, you could if you wanted to. You'd just pay a heavy price in terms of convenience, performance, and quite probably, your hair. The problem with smart contracts isn't just that people's expectations are overblown, it's that these expectations are leading many to spend time and money on ideas that cannot possibly be implemented. It seems large companies have sufficient resources to travel a lengthy path - from the moment when senior management encounters a new technology, to when that technology's advantages and limitations are truly understood. Perhaps our own experience can help shorten this time. Over the past nine months, we've been pitched many smart contract use cases, and have found ourselves responding, time and again, that they simply cannot be done. As a result, we've identified the three smart contract misconceptions that are most commonly held. These ideas aren't wrong because the technology is immature, or the tools are not yet available. Rather, they misunderstand the fundamental properties of code which lives in a database and runs in a decentralized way. 1. Contacting external services Often, the first use case proposed is a smart contract that changes its behavior in response to some external event. For example, an agricultural insurance policy which pays out conditionally based on the quantity of rainfall in a given month. The imagined process goes something like this: The smart contract waits until the predetermined time, retrieves the weather report from an external service and behaves appropriately based on the data received. This all sounds simple enough, but it's also impossible. Why? Because a blockchain is a consensus-based system, meaning that it only works if every node reaches an identical state after processing every transaction and block. Everything that takes place on a blockchain must be completely deterministic, with no possible way for differences to creep in. The moment that two honest nodes disagree about the chain's state, the entire system becomes worthless. Now, recall that smart contracts are executed independently by every node on a chain. Therefore, if a smart contract retrieves some information from an external source, this retrieval is performed repeatedly and separately by each node. But because this source is outside of the blockchain, there is no guarantee that every node will receive the same answer. Perhaps the source will change its response in the time between requests from different nodes, or perhaps it will become temporarily unavailable. Either way, consensus is broken and the entire blockchain dies. So, what's the workaround? Actually, it's rather simple. Instead of a smart contract initiating the retrieval of external data, one or more trusted parties (""oracles"") creates a transaction which embeds that data in the chain. Every node will have an identical copy of this data, so it can be safely used in a smart contract computation. In other words, an oracle pushes the data onto the blockchain rather than a smart contract pulling it in. When it comes to smart contracts causing events in the outside world, a similar problem appears. For example, many like the idea of a smart contract which calls a bank's API in order to transfer money. But if every node is independently executing the code in the chain, who is responsible for calling this API? If the answer is just one node, what happens if that particular node malfunctions, deliberately or not? And if the answer is every node, can we trust every node with that API's password? And do we really want the API called hundreds of times? Even worse, if the smart contract needs to know whether the API call was successful, we're right back to the problem of depending on external data. As before, a simple workaround is available. Instead of the smart contract calling an external API, we use a trusted service which monitors the blockchain's state and performs certain actions in response. For example, a bank could proactively watch a blockchain and perform money transfers which mirror the on-chain transactions. This presents no risk to the blockchain's consensus because the chain plays an entirely passive role. Looking at these two workarounds, we can make some observations. First, they both require a trusted entity to manage the interactions between the blockchain and the outside world. While this is technically possible, it undermines the goal of a decentralized system. Second, the mechanisms used in these workarounds are straightforward examples of reading and writing a database. An oracle which provides external information is simply writing that information into the chain. And a service which mirrors the blockchain's state in the real world is doing nothing more than reading from that chain. In other words, any interaction between a blockchain and the outside world is restricted to regular database operations. We'll talk more about this fact later on. 2. Enforcing on-chain payments Here's another proposal that we tend to hear a lot: using a smart contract to automate the payment of coupons for a so-called ""smart bond"". The idea is for the smart contract code to automatically initiate the payments at the appropriate times, avoiding manual processes and guaranteeing that the issuer cannot default. Of course, in order for this to work, the funds used to make the payments must live inside the blockchain as well, otherwise a smart contract could not possibly guarantee their payment. Recall that a blockchain is just a database, in this case a financial ledger containing the issued bond and some cash. So, when we talk about coupon payments, what we're actually talking about are database operations which take place automatically at an agreed time. While this automation is technically feasible, it suffers from a financial difficulty. If the funds used for coupon payments are controlled by the bond's smart contract, then those payments can indeed be guaranteed. But this also means those funds cannot be used by the bond issuer for anything else. And if those funds aren't under the control of the smart contract, then there is no way in which payment can be guaranteed. In other words, a smart bond is either pointless for the issuer, or pointless for the investor. And if you think about it, this is a completely obvious outcome. From an investor's perspective, the whole point of a bond is its attractive rate of return, at the cost of some risk of default. And for the issuer, a bond's purpose is to raise funds for a productive but somewhat risky activity, such as building a new factory. There is no way for the bond issuer to make use of the funds raised, while simultaneously guaranteeing that the investor will be repaid. It should not come as a surprise that the connection between risk and return is not a problem that blockchains can solve. 3. Hiding confidential data As I've written about previously, the biggest challenge in deploying blockchains is the radical transparency which they provide. For example, if 10 banks set up a blockchain together, and two conduct a bilateral transaction, this will be immediately visible to the other eight. While there are various strategies for mitigating this problem, none beat the simplicity and efficiency of a centralized database in which a trusted administrator has full control over who can see what. Some people think that smart contracts can solve this problem. They start with the fact that each smart contract contains its own miniature database, over which it has full control. All read and write operations on this database are mediated by the contract's code, making it impossible for one contract to read another's data directly. (This tight coupling between data and code is called encapsulation, and is the foundation of the popular object-oriented programming paradigm). So, if one smart contract can't access another's data, have we solved the problem of blockchain confidentiality? Does it make sense to talk of hiding information in a smart contract? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Because even if one smart contract can't read another's data, that data is still stored on every single node in the chain. For each blockchain participant, it's in the memory or disk of a system which that participant completely controls. And there's nothing to stop them reading the information from their own system, if and when they choose to do so. Hiding data in a smart contract is about as secure as hiding it in the HTML code of a web page. Sure, regular web users won't see it, because it's not displayed in their browser window. But all it takes is for a web browser to add a 'View Source' function (as they all have), and the information becomes universally visible. Similarly, for data hidden in smart contracts, all it takes is for someone to modify their blockchain software to display the contract's full state, and all semblance of secrecy is lost. A half-decent programmer could do that in an hour or so. What smart contracts are for With so many things that smart contracts cannot do, one might ask what they're actually for. But in order to answer this question, we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchains themselves. To recap, a blockchain enables a database to be directly and safely shared by entities who do not trust each other, without requiring a central administrator. Blockchains enable data disintermediation, and this can lead to significant savings in complexity and cost. Any database is modified via ""transactions"", which contain a set of changes to that database which must succeed or fail as a whole. For example, in a financial ledger, a payment from Alice to Bob is represented by a transaction that (a) checks if Alice has sufficient funds, (b) deducts a quantity from Alice's account and (c) adds the same quantity to Bob's. In a regular centralized database, these transactions are created by a single trusted authority. By contrast, in a blockchain-driven shared database, transactions can be created by any of that blockchain's users. And since these users do not fully trust each other, the database has to contain rules which restrict the transactions performed. For example, in a peer-to-peer financial ledger, each transaction must preserve the total quantity of funds, otherwise participants could freely give themselves as much money as they liked. One can imagine various ways of expressing these rules, but for now there are two dominant paradigms, inspired by bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. The bitcoin method, which we might call ""transaction constraints"", evaluates each transaction in terms of: (a) the database entries deleted by that transaction and (b) the entries created. In a financial ledger, the rule states that the total quantity of funds in the deleted entries has to match the total in those created. (We consider the modification of an existing entry to be equivalent to deleting that entry and creating a new one in its place). The second paradigm, which comes from Ethereum, is smart contracts. This states that all modifications to a contract's data must be performed by its code. (In the context of traditional databases, we can think of this as an enforced stored procedure.) To modify a contract's data, blockchain users send requests to its code, which determines whether and how to fulfill those requests. As in this example, the smart contract for a financial ledger performs the same three tasks as the administrator of a centralized database: checking for sufficient funds, deducting from one account and adding to another. Both of these paradigms are effective, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. To summarize, bitcoin-style transaction constraints provide superior concurrency and performance, while Ethereum-style smart contracts offer greater flexibility. So to return to the question of what smart contracts are for: Smart contracts are for blockchain use cases which can't be implemented with transaction constraints. Given this criterion for using smart contracts, I'm yet to see a strong use case for permissioned blockchains which qualifies. All the compelling blockchain applications I know can be implemented with bitcoin-style transactions, which can handle permissioning and general data storage, as well as asset creation, transfer, escrow, exchange and destruction. Nonetheless, new use cases are still appearing, and I wouldn't be surprised if some do require the power of smart contracts. Or, at the very least, an extension of the bitcoin paradigm. Whatever the answer turns out to be, the key to remember is that smart contracts are simply one method for restricting the transactions performed in a database. This is undoubtedly a useful thing, and is essential to making that database safe for sharing. But smart contracts cannot do anything else, and they certainly cannot escape the boundaries of the database in which they reside.

Por muito tempo, fazer algo ""como uma garota"" foi considerado pejorativo. Infelizmente, para algumas pessoas, isso ainda é visto como sinônimo de fraqueza, vulnerabilidade ou falta de técnica. Nada disso tem qualquer fundamento na realidade e o uso dessa expressão de forma depreciativa está com os dias contados. Após uma linda campanha da Always que valoriza o que é feito como uma garota (#LikeAGirl), a ilustradora, desenvolvedora de jogos e gamer Kaol Porfírio, do Rio Grande do Sul, criou uma série de ilustrações chamada Fight Like a Girl, ou Lute Como Uma Garota. Nela, estão representadas guerreiras famosas da ficção, para provar que as mulheres também podem ser lutadoras impiedosas e inspiradoras. Em sua página do Facebook , Kaol já desenhou Sarah Connor, Xena, Mulan e Beatrix Kiddo. Ela nos concedeu uma entrevista na qual fala sobre a série e sua experiência como mulher no mundo dos games, cuja famosa misoginia é desafiada diariamente por garotas no mundo inteiro que lutam por seu direito e sua voz em uma indústria que é em boa parte financiada por elas . A convite do Think Olga, Kaol fez uma edição especial do Fight Like a Girl só com feministas famosas. Confira abaixo as ilustras e a nossa conversa com a artista. Como você avalia a participação feminina na indústria dos games na atualidade? A participação feminina na industria de jogos é muito baixa. Normalmente em cursos de jogos ou de especializando na área as mulheres fazem parte de 5% dos alunos, e acredito que não deva passar dos 20% em empresas. A industria de jogos ainda é bastante nova, eu tenho esperança a presença de mulheres na industria de jogos aumente. Um movimento chamado #1ReasonWhy reuniu vários desabafos de desenvolvedoras de jogos e com eles dá para ter uma grande ideia quao hostil é a área e quanto amor você precisa ter para trabalhar na mesma. Há muitas críticas sobre a forma sexualizada como as personagens de games são retratadas. Qual sua visão sobre essas críticas? São fundamentadas? A sexualização excessiva e a objetificação de personagens femininas nos jogos não tem nada de diferente de qualquer industria de enterimento focada no publico masculino, muita vezes com a desculpa de ser apenas ""fantasia"" ou ""liberdade do design"". Mas o que realmente acontece é a mulher sendo retratada como um objeto apenas para agradar o publico masculino, ignorando totalmente as jogadoras, que pelos últimos números do ESA, são 48% do publico. Sem falar que na maioria das vezes, as personagens não possuem nenhum valor pra trama, estão ali para ""enfeite"". A mulher é, na maioria das vezes, mal representada nos jogos. O que as mulheres podem fazer para poder conquistar mais espaço na indústria dos games, que ainda é entendida como uma indústria masculina? Vejo muitas mulheres se destacando na industria, isso dá força e encoraja. Na ultima Global Game Jam (evento onde desenvolvedores se reúnem para produzir jogos em 48 horas) o vídeo de abertura do evento contou com um trecho onde a desenvolvedora brasileira Amora Bettany, da Miniboss, trouxe um discuso de desconstrução bastante claro, e acredito que isso tenha atingido muitas pessoas, e quem sabe, feito elas saírem das suas ""caixinhas"". Mulheres como ela, mostram que é possivel mudar o ambiente e conquistar seu espaço, sendo um exemplo para as próximas. Você já sofreu algum tipo de preconceito no seu trabalho como game developer? Em caso positivo, por favor nos conte. Em caso negativo, já testemunhou alguma outra mulher sofrer preconceito? Em um evento de jogos é comum de acontecer das pessoas me ignorarem, acreditando que estou ali apenas para ""acompanhar meu namorado"". E essa reclamação não é só minha, veio de uma amiga, em um evento, que se sentiu ignorada em conversas. Eu tento sempre estar com pessoas que me conhecem e que confio, e como game developer, aqui no sul, temos uma associação de devs - adjogosrs -bastante unida, o que me deixa bastante tranquila na área. Já como gamer, a coisa muda. Somos tratadas extremamente mal em jogos online. Escondo sempre minha foto de perfil, minha voz e evito chat. Já fui chamada de muita coisas, simplesmente pelo fato de ser mulher. Além claro, de cantadas e mais cantadas. É cansativo e humilhante. Por que você decidiu fazer a série FIGHT LIKE A GIRL? E por que você acha que ela fez tanto sucesso? Iniciei a ""Fight Like a Girl"" com o proposito de desabafo, e acredito que muitas mulheres se identificaram com a série pelo mesmo motivo. Meu desejo é homenagear mulheres fortes que podemos nos orgulhar, que mesmo fictícias, inspiram a vida de muitas pessoas. Não havia nenhuma intensão de sucesso. Na verdade eu nunca imaginei que iria ter o feedback que estou tendo com a série. É gratificante e inesperado. Iniciei e publiquei. Em uma semana ganhei mil curtidas e muitos comentários, tanto de elogios quanto de pedidos. Foi então que notei o quanto mulheres se identificaram e precisavam lembram que sim, existem mulheres que lutam! Quais são as próximas personagens a serem retratadas na série? Há pedidos das leitoras? Quem elas querem que apareça? Existem muitos pedidos, muito emocionantes. Um dos mais pedidos foi da Korra, da série Avatar. Eu não imaginava que uma personagem de uma série pudesse ter ajudado tantas mulheres de tantas formas diferentes. Noto que a maioria são personagens já antigas, como por exemplo a protagonista de Kill Bill e a Xena. A lista ainda está grande e por isso não sei até quando a série vai.
